Invalid (INV, nullflavor)	invalid	HL7 v3 	2_INV	The value as represented in the instance is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.
Derived (DER, nullflavor)	derived	HL7 v3 	3_DER	An actual value may exist, but it must be derived from the provided information.
Other (OTH, nullflavor)	other	HL7 v3 	3_OTH	The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.
Negative infinity (NINF, nullflavor)	negative infinity	HL7 v3 	4_NINF	Negative infinity of numbers.
Positive infinity (PINF, nullflavor)	positive infinity	HL7 v3 	4_PINF	Positive infinity of numbers.
Un-encoded (UNC, nullflavor)	un-encoded	HL7 v3	3_UNC	The actual value has not yet been encoded within the approved value domain.
Masked (MSK, nullflavor)	masked	HL7 v3	2_MSK	There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by the sender due to security, privacy or other reasons.
Not applicable (NA, nullflavor)	not applicable	HL7 v3	2_NA	Known to have no proper value.
Unknown (UNK, nullflavor)	unknown	HL7 v3	2_UNK	A proper value is applicable, but not known.
