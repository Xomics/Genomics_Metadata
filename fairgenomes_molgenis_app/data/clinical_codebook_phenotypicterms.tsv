Dolichocephaly	An abnormality of skull shape characterized by a increased anterior-posterior diameter, i.e., an increased antero-posterior dimension of the skull. Cephalic index less than 76%. Alternatively, an apparently increased antero-posterior length of the head compared to width. Often due to premature closure of the sagittal suture.,Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Dolichocephaly is distinct from Prominent occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately. Scaphocephaly is a subtype of dolichocephaly where the anterior and posterior aspects of the cranial vault are pointed (boat-shaped).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002648	HP_0000268	Narrow head shape,Narrow skull shape,Narrow cranium shape,Turridolichocephaly,Tall and narrow skull,Long, narrow head,Large dolichocephalic skull

Turricephaly	Tall head relative to width and length.,Turricephaly is derived from the Latin word turris, meaning tall, and refers to a round, tall (tower-like) skull. This feature may have previously been considered to overlap with or include a tall forehead. Turricephaly is present when the head appears tall (subjective) and head length and width are reduced compared to normal age-related standards (objective). Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers.

Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far below the normal standard the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Microcephaly is an absolute term. The term relative microcephaly can be used when the head size centile is less than the centile for height, for example, head size at the 3rd centile with height at the 75% for age and sex. On prenatal ultrasound, microcephaly is diagnosed if the head circumference or the biparietal diameter is more than three standard deviations below the mean.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0040195,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007364	HP_0000252	Decreased size of head,Small skull,Abnormally small head,Small head,Abnormally small skull,small cranium,Reduced head circumference,Decreased size of cranium,Abnormally small cranium,small calvarium,Decreased size of skull,Decreased circumference of cranium,Small head circumference

Secondary hyperparathyroidism	Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the production of higher than normal levels of parathyroid hormone in the presence of hypocalcemia.,Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs most commonly secondary to chronic renal failure. Other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism include osteomalacia, rickets, and malabsorption. The pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism results from abnormalities in the renal tubular absorption of phosphate with reduced phosphate excretion and hyperphosphatemia, as well as impaired renal conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferal to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which in turn leads to a decrease in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In combination, elevated serum phosphate levels and reduced vitamin D production result in decreases in serum calcium levels or hypocalcemia, leading to hyperparathyroidism.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000843	HP_0000867

Oligodontia	A developmental anomaly characterized by a reduced number of teeth, whereby more than 6 teeth are missing.,The diagnosis of oligodontia requires a radiograph, as is true for anodontia and for the other designation of tooth agenesis, hypodontia. The terms hypodontia and oligodontia are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature while on other occasions hypodontia is used for selective agenesis of six or less missing teeth while oligodontia is applied when there are more than six missing teeth. Tooth agenesis or oligodontia/hypodontia can be mistaken for delayed eruption and again a radiograph is needed for diagnosis. Absence of teeth may be congenital (tooth agenesis) or acquired. The incidence of congenital absence of teeth is different depending on the type and position of the tooth [Gorlin et al, 2001].	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009804	HP_0000677	Partial anodontia,Failure of development of more than six teeth,Number of teeth decreased by more than six,Missing more than six teeth

Alternatively, an apparently shortened anteroposterior dimension (length) of the head compared to width.,Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms also have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Brachycephaly is distinct from Flat occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002648	HP_0000248	Broad cranium shape,Broad skull shape,Broad head shape,Wide skull shape,Wide cranium shape,Wide head shape,Short and broad skull

Dandy-Walker malformation	A congenital brain malformation typically characterized by incomplete formation of the cerebellar vermis, dilation of the fourth ventricle, and enlargement of the posterior fossa. In layman's terms, Dandy Walker malformation is a cyst in the cerebellum (typically symmetrical) that is involved with the fourth ventricle. This may interfere with the ability to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, resulting in hydrocephalus. Dandy Walker cysts are formed during early embryonic development, while the brain forms. The cyst in the cerebellum typically has several blood vessels running through it connecting to the brain, thereby prohibiting surgical removal.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002350,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002198,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005445,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001320	HP_0001305	Dandy-Walker cyst,Dandy-walker anomaly

Thin upper lip vermilion	Height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the midline more than 2 SD below the mean. Alternatively, an apparently reduced height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the frontal view (subjective).,Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or use the Likert scale for Caucasians and African Americans [Astley and Clarren, 2000]. The height of the vermilion of the upper lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thinness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to facial expression. On profile view, a thin vermilion is less convex than usual. A thin upper lip vermilion may be associated with a smooth philtrum and an absence of the Cupid's bow, but these should be assessed separately.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011339,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000233	HP_0000219	Thin upper lip,Thin vermilion border of upper lip,Decreased volume of upper lip vermilion,Decreased height of upper lip vermilion,Decreased volume of upper lip,Thin red part of the upper lip,Thin upper lips

Dysmetria	A type of ataxia characterized by the inability to carry out movements with the correct range and motion across the plane of more than one joint related to incorrect estimation of the distances required for targeted movements.,Dysmetria can result in moving beyond the target (hypermetria) or failing to reach the target (hypometria) during a voluntary movement. Dysmetria can be assessed clinically by the finger chase test, whereby the examiner and the proband are sitting, and the examiner suddenly moves his or her finger five times in an unpredictable direction in a frontal plane, with movements having an amplitude of about 30 cm and a frequency of once every two seconds. The proband is asked to follow the movements with his or her index finger. The test is abnormal if the proband substantially under- or overshoots or cannot perform pointing movements at all. The finger-nose-finger test is similar, and the proband is asked to alternately touch his or her own nose and then to point to the finger of the examiner.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001251	HP_0001310	Lack of coordination of movement,Abnormal finger chase test,Abnormal finger-nose-finger test

Thick upper lip vermilion	Height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the midline more than 2 SD above the mean. Alternatively, an apparently increased height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the frontal view (subjective).,Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or utilize the Likert scale of Astley and Clarren [2000] (Fig. 17). The vermilion of the upper lip varies considerably among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thickness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to the facial expression. On profile view, a thick vermilion is more convex than usual.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011339,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012471	HP_0000215	Full upper lip,Full upper lip vermilion,Increased volume of upper lip vermilion,Increased height of upper lip vermilion,Thick vermilion border of upper lip,Thick upper lip,Plump upper lip,Increased volume of upper lip,Prominent upper lip,Prominent upper lip vermilion,Thick red part of the upper lip
Depressed nasal ridge	Lack of prominence of the nose resulting from a posteriorly-placed nasal ridge.,The adjective 'depressed' here does not indicate an active process but a status.

Microdontia	Decreased size of the teeth, which can be defined as a mesiodistal tooth diameter (width) more than 2 SD below mean. Alternatively, an apparently decreased maximum width of tooth.,Standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. It is easy to measure the width of teeth, for which reason the definition of microdontia can be made with reference to the width of the tooth. However, microdontia means that the overall size of the tooth is decreased. In microdontia, the gaps between the teeth, particularly the anterior upper and lower teeth, are increased, creating diastemata. This should be assessed and coded separately.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0006482	HP_0000691	Hypotrophic tooth,Small tooth,Decreased size of tooth,Decreased width of tooth,Small teeth

Chorioretinal atrophy	Atrophy of the choroid and retinal layers of the fundus.,Choroidal sclerosis is a descriptive term applied to the ophthalmoscopic appearance of prominent white choroidal vessels in which the blood columns are not seen or are sheathed by white lines. Choroidal sclerosis is a term used to describe a group of genetically heterogeneous retinal dystrophies that share a common funduscopic phenotype of scalloped, well-circumscribed, and confluent chorioretinal atrophic lesions that extend beyond the macula. The term choroidal sclerosis was initially coined because of the sclerotic appearance of choroidal vessels which frequently appear white or light-yellow. However, histologic studies have demonstrated the term to be a misnomer as the principle abnormality is the loss of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the outer retina in the absence of abnormal sclerotic changes in the choroidal vasculature. Therefore, we are making choroidal sclerosis a synonym of chorioretinal atrophy.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200065	HP_0000533	Chorioretinal thinning

This type of neutropenia is commonly seen with autoimmune neutropenia of infancy (AIN), also called primary autoimmune neutropenia, is a disease in which antibodies recognize membrane antigens of neutrophils, mostly located on immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptor type 3b (Fc-gamma-IIIb receptor), causing their peripheral destruction.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001875,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002960	HP_0001904	Autoimmune neutropenia
Anemia	A reduction in erythrocytes volume or hemoglobin concentration.,Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001877	HP_0001903	Low number of red blood cells or hemoglobin,Anaemia,Decreased hemoglobin

Hypoketotic hypoglycemia	A decreased concentration of glucose in the blood associated with a reduced concentration of ketone bodies.,Normally, decreased glucose production leads to increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones. Thus, ketones provide an indication of whether the hypoglycemia is a result of inadequate production or overutilization of glucose (which tends to be associated with low plasma ketone levels). Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism. A good starting point for evaluating hypoglycemia is to divide patients into ketotic or non-ketotic. Normal physiologic response to decreased glucose production is increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and the production of ketones. Ketones provide an indirect indication of whether hypoglycemia is the result of inadequate production or of over-utilization of glucose (insulin-induced over-utilization, associated with low urine or plasma ketones). The history of the relationship of the hypoglycemia to feeding is often helpful. Hypoketotic hypoglycemia developing within several minutes of feeding is typical of hyperinsulinism. Patients with defects in glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, or fatty acid oxidation tend to tolerate short-term fasting much better.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001943	HP_0001985	Hypoglycemia, hypoketotic

Viral infections, mainly with CMV and rubella, are commonly found when the pseudocysts are associated with other abnormalities of the central nervous system. The pseudocysts are then often multilocular.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010576,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002118	HP_0002416	
Molar tooth sign on MRI	An abnormal appearance of the midbrain in axial magnetic resonance imaging in which the elongated superior cerebellar peduncles give the midbrain an appearance reminiscent of a molar or wisdom tooth.,Molar tooth appearance results from a lack of normal decussation of superior cerebellar peduncular fiber tracts which in turn leads to enlargement of the peduncles, which also follow a more horizontal course. The absence of crossing fibers also leads to a reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and deepening of the interpeduncular cistern.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002418	HP_0002419	molar tooth sign' on brain imaging','molar tooth' sign on imaging,Molar tooth sign

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030846	HP_0002639

Type IV atherosclerotic lesion	In type IV atherosclerotic lesions a dense accumulation of extracellular lipid occupies an extensive but well-defined region of the intima. This type of extracellular lipid accumulation is known as the lipid core. A fibrous tissue increase is not a feature, and complications such as defects of the lesion surface and thrombosis are not present. The type IV lesion is also known as atheroma. Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type.

Patent ductus arteriosus	In utero, the ductus arteriosus (DA) serves to divert ventricular output away from the lungs and toward the placenta by connecting the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the first 3 days of life is a physiologic shunt in healthy term and preterm newborn infants, and normally is substantially closed within about 24 hours after bith and completely closed after about three weeks. Failure of physiologcal closure is referred to a persistent or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Depending on the degree of left-to-right shunting, PDA can have clinical consequences.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011603	HP_0001643	Ductus arteriosus,Persistent ductus arteriosus,Persistent arterial duct

Pulmonic stenosis	A narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract that can occur at the pulmonary valve (valvular stenosis) or just below the pulmonary valve (infundibular stenosis).,Infundibular pulmonic stenosis is mostly caused by overgrowth of the heart muscle wall (hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculae). Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity. This malformation is infrequently described as sub-pulmonary stenosis or subpulmonary obstruction.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031654	HP_0001642	Pulmonic valve stenosis,Pulmonary stenosis,Narrowing of pulmonic valve,Pulmonary valve stenosis

Coarctation of aorta	Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of a segment of the aorta.,Coarctation refers to a narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow. Coarctation can occur in any region of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is often a discrete obstruction commonly located in the descending thoracic aorta. More specifically, it is usually located in the juxtaductal position immediately distal to the left-subclavian artery in a left-sided arch. The hallmark clinical finding in coarctation of the aorta is hypertension proximal to the lesion, with diminished blood pressure distal to the obstruction. Consequently, clinical diagnosis can be made by the presence of diminished lower extremity pulses, differences in timing between upper extremity central pulses (often brachial) and lower extremity central pulses (often femoral), or the presence of a supine arm-leg blood pressure gradient.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001679	HP_0001680	Narrowing of the aorta,Aortic coarctation,Narrowing of aorta,Coarctation of the aorta

The term pseudotumor cerebri (also: idiopathic intracranial hypertension or benign intracranial hypertension) is the presence of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a brain tumor or other identifiable cause. It should be coded using this term and negations of appropriate other HPO terms. Increased intracranial pressure can damage tissue, contribute to hydrocephalus, cause brain herniation, and restrict blood supply to the brain.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012640	HP_0002516	Intracranial hypertension,Rise in pressure inside skull,Intracranial pressure elevation

Waddling gait	Weakness of the hip girdle and upper thigh muscles, for instance in myopathies, leads to an instability of the pelvis on standing and walking. If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288	HP_0002515	Waddling walk,'Waddling' gait

Somatic mutation	A mode of inheritance in which a trait or disorder results from a de novo mutation occurring after conception, rather than being inherited from a preceding generation.,This term applies to a disease whose etiology is related to an alteration in DNA that occurs after conception. Somatic mutations  occur in all body tissues throughout life and are not present in the germline from which the individual developed (The Greek word soma means body.) The majority of somatic mutations have no phenotypic effect. However, occasionally they may have functional consequences that confer a selective advantage on the cell owing to preferential growth or survival. These so-called driver mutations may ultimately lead to cancer or other diseases.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000005	HP_0001428

Hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common type of rickets that is characterized by low levels of serum phosphate, resistance to ultraviolet radiation or vitamin D intake. There are several issues involved in hypophosphatemic rickets such as calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus deficiencies. Moreover, other disorder can be associated with its occurrence such as absorption defects due to pancreatic, intestinal, gastric, and renal disorders and hepatobiliary disease. Symptoms are usually seen in childhood and can be varied in severity. Severe forms may be linked to bowing of the legs, poor bone growth, and short stature as well as joint and bone pain. Hypophosphatemic rickets are associated with renal excretion of phosphate, hypophosphatemia, and mineral defects in bones.

Abnormality of peripheral nerve conduction	An abnormality of the conduction of electrical impulses by peripheral (motor or sensory) nerves. This finding is elicited by a nerve conduction study (NCS).,A nerve conduction study (NCS) is commonly conducted together with electromyography in order to evaluate muscle disorders. For the NCS, dermal electrodes are placed at intervals over the nerve to be examined, and a low-intensity current is introducted to generate action potentials. The velocity of the action potential is related to the diameter of the nerve fiber and the presence of a myelin sheath. Diseases of the myelin sheath characteristically reduce the nerve conduction velocity (NCV). The amplitude of the response is also measured.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030177,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0045010	HP_0003134	Sensory and motor nerve conduction abnormalities,Abnormal peripheral nerve transmission

Vertebral segmentation defect	An abnormality related to a defect of vertebral separation during development.,The vertebral column derives from somites, transient paired segments of mesoderm that surround the neural tube in the early embryo. The formation of the vertebrar involves many processes including resegmentation of the rostral and caudal regions of adjacent somites that then fuse to form vertebral elements. Disruption of these processes can a cause of severe segmentation defects of the vetebrae. The frequency of segmentation defects of the vetebra has been estimated at 0.5 of 1000 births. The range of segmentation defects includes left-right uneven formation of somites that results in hemivertebrae or wedge vertebrae. Incomplete segmentation can result in fused segments such as block vertebrae. A failure of the process of resegmentation and migration of the sclerotomal compartment can result in a failure of midline fusion, such as butterlfy vertebrae.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003468	HP_0003422	Abnormal spinal segmentation

Abnormal muscle fiber morphology	Any abnormality of the skeletal muscle cell. Muscle fibers are subdivided into two types. Type I fibers are fatigue-resistant and rich in oxidative enzymes (they stain light with the myosin ATPase reaction), and type II fibers are fast-contracting, fatigue-prone, and rich in glycolytic enzymes (these fibers stain darkly). Normal muscle tissue has a random distribution of type I and type II fibers.,Normal human muscle is composed of many individual muscle fibers bundled together by layers of connective tissue that are arranged in a nesting-doll like fashion. The inner most structure, the single muscle fiber, is covered by a thin layer of primarily reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium is quite inconspicuous and muscle fibers appear to be in direct contact with each other. The finest capillaries, nerve twigs and lymphatic capillaries are found within the endomysium. Groups of muscle fibers are bound together by the thicker perimysium, forming structures called fascicles. Capillaries, nerve fibers and lymphatic vessels also track in the perimyseum. Bundles of fascicles are encased within the dense irregular connective tissue of the epimysium. These connective tissue layers provide mechanical protection for the muscle fibers and increase the tensile strength of the muscle. The layers are continuous with the tendon, which provides attachment to bone. Individual muscle fibers are syncytia, formed by embryonic fusion of many myoblasts or later, myosatellite cells. Each muscle fiber contains many nuclei, peripherally positioned immediately adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane. In healthy muscle only 3-5 percent of fibers contain nuclei that are located internally, within the cell, but many disease processes lead to internal nuclei. Each nucleus provides a segment of the cell with needed translated protein products.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011805	HP_0004303	Abnormal skeletal muscle fiber morphology,Abnormality of muscle fibers

To perform the test, pressure is maintained throughout the test by inflating a sphygmomanometer cuff on the upper arm. The dorsal surface of the forearm is then cleaned, and the bleeding time device placed onto the skin and the trigger is depressed. At 30-second intervals, the flow of blood is blotted with filter paper. The time from puncture to cessation of bleeding is then recorded as the bleeding time.

Macrodactyly	Significant increase in the length and girth of most or all of a digit compared to its contralateral digit (if unaffected) or compared to what would be expected for age/body build. The increased girth is accompanied by an increase in the dorso-ventral dimension AND the lateral dimension of the digit.,There are no recognized standards for the girth of digits and this finding can vary substantially in the population. This assessment relies on the judgment of the examiner to recognize when the difference between the expected and the observed is significant. The affected digits should be specified. The definition does not mandate the component of the increased size (bone, connective tissue, etc.), but should exclude edema. The requirement that the girth is most, or all, of the digit is intended to distinguish this from broad fingertips. This should be distinguished from Broad fingers or Broad fingertips as the girth is circumferential in macrodactyly, which is not the case for broad fingers or broad fingertips, which are increased only (or predominantly) in their lateral (A/P) width.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011297	HP_0004099	Megalodactyly,Finger overgrowth

Tubulointerstitial fibrosis	A progressive detrimental connective tissue deposition (fibrosis) on the kidney parenchyma involving the tubules and interstitial tissue of the kidney.,This finding is usually shown by renal biopsy. Fibrosis involves an excess accumulation of extracellular matrix and usually results in loss of function when normal tissue is replaced with scar tissue. Tubulointerstitial renal fibrosis, characterized as a progressive detrimental connective tissue deposition on the kidney parenchyma, appears to be a harmful process leading inevitably to renal function deterioration, independently of the primary renal disease which causes the original kidney injury. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of tubular epithelial cells which are transformed to mesenchymal fibroblasts migrating to adjacent interstitial parenchyma constitutes the principal mechanism of renal fibrosis along with local and circulating cells.

Delayed patellar ossification	Formation of bone in the patella later than normal.,The patella initially ossifies at between three and five years, commencing as multiple foci that rapidly coalesce. As the patellar ossification center enlarges the expanding margins may be irregular and associated with accessory ossification centers. These are most common superolaterally and may lead to the development of a bipartite patella. The bipartite patella has cartilaginous continuity despite the appearance of osseous discontinuity. The patella expands to all cartilaginous contours during late adolescence when the epiphyseal ossification centers around the knee are also in the final stages of maturation. The only cartilage not replaced is that occupying the superior two-thirds of the articular surface (the lower one-third is covered by the fat pad). The subchondral plate does not assume the actual articular contours until the late stages of osseous maturation (after ten to twelve years). Accordingly, typical measurements such as medial and lateral angulation cannot be accurately done prior to the final stages of patellar ossification expansion and maturation (pmid:6729496).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003045,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003336	HP_0006454	Delayed patellae ossification,Delayed bone maturation of the knee cap

Failure of this process results in AVSD, with the degree of severity dependent on the stage at which the developmental failure occurs. AVSD are a spectrum of cardiac malformations that result in a persistent common atrioventricular canal.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001671	HP_0006695	Hole in center of heart,Endocardial cushion defect,Atrioventricular septal defect

Reduced von Willebrand factor activity	Decreased activity of von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor mediates the adhesion of platelets to the collagen exposed on endothelial cell surfaces.,Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a key hemostatic protein, but documenting its function through laboratory tests is not always straightforward. VWF serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII (FVIII), and also facilitates platelet adhesion through its interaction with platelet GPIb on the platelet surface and through its binding to the subendothelial matrix. This interaction is driven in vivo by shear stress, which induces a conformational change in VWF that allows it to bind platelet GPIb. In vitro, however, this interaction is induced by the antibiotic ristocetin, which enables VWF and platelet GPIb to interact in the absence of shear forces. Laboratory testing of VWF utilizes ristocetin in the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity assay (VWF:RCo), which is a measure of VWF binding to platelets, or by ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012146	HP_0008330	Decreased von willebrand factor activity

Prolonged prothrombin time	Increased time to coagulation in the prothrombin time test, which is a measure of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. The results of the prothrombin time test are often expressed in terms of the International normalized ratio (INR), which is calculated as a ratio of the patient's prothrombin time (PT) to a control PT standardized for the potency of the thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the formula: INR is equal to Patient PT divided by Control PT.,The prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are the most requested tests to investigate patients with congenital or acquired coagulopathies and drug monitoring. They are defined as the time (seconds) needed to clot platelet-poor plasma upon addition of coagulation triggers, such as tissue factor in complex with phospholipids and calcium chloride (in the PT), or negatively charged phospholipids-activators and calcium chloride (in the APTT). They can hence be considered as global coagulation tests sensitive to deficiencies of many coagulation factors. In brief, they are both sensitive to factor X, V, II and fibrinogen, whereas the PT is only sensitive to factor VII deficiency and the APTT is sensitive to pre-kallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), factor XII, XI, IX and VIII deficiencies. Normal plasma in the PT clots approximately within 10-12 s upon triggering coagulation, and the normal reference range is (usually) narrow. PT results have been reported as clotting time, percentage activity, PT-ratio (patient-to-normal clotting time) and as international normalized ratio (INR). The INR scale has been devised to harmonize results stemming from different thromboplastins from patients on treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Some recommend abandoning the approach of using percentage activity to assess PR.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032199	HP_0008151	Increased international normalized ratio,Low factor II activity,Reduced prothrombin activity,increased international normalised ratio,Increased INR,Prolonged PT,Reduced factor II activity

Laryngeal atresia	Congenital absence of the lumen of the larynx.,Laryngeal atresia results from failure of recanalization of the laryngotracheal tube during the third month of gestation. Laryngeal atresia manifests as acute airway obstruction in the newborn immediately following clamping of the umbilical cord and is fatal without immediate airway management with a tracheotomy. Congenital laryngeal atresia is a rare anomaly that is mostly incompatible with life. Most authors claim that this malformation is related to an arrest of the sixth brachial arch at different gestational stages during normal embryologic development. Complete laryngeal atresia results in a desperate emergency during the first few moments of life, and surgical intervention must occur within 2 to 5 minutes of birth to enable respiration. The most dramatic physical finding is that the child is aphonic, with absence of any cry or gasp at birth.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025423	HP_0008750

Mild fetal ventriculomegaly	A kind of ventriculomegaly occurring in the fetal period and usually diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Cerebral ventriculomegaly is defined by atrial measurements 10 mm or more. Mild ventriculomegaly (MVM) is defined as measurements between 10 and 15 mm. Measurements are obtained from an axial plane at the level of the thalamic nuclei just below the standard image to measure the BPD (pmid:16100637).,A ventricular atrial diameter of more than 10 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation has been accepted as defining ventriculomegaly because it represents at least 3 standard deviations above the mean (which is roughly 5 mm at 20-24 weeks of gestation). If the diameter is above 15 mm, the ventriculomegaly is considered to be severe. Amongst the most common causes of ventriculomegaly are impaired absorption of CSF, developmental cerebral defects, and destroyed brain tissue.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002119,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011425	HP_0010952

Mirror image polydactyly	A hand or foot with more than five digits that has a recognizable A/P axis of symmetry. The axis can lie within a normally formed or partially duplicated digit resembling a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe, or hallux. Alternatively, the axis can be in an interdigital space with a flanking pair of digits that resemble a middle finger, index finger, thumb, toe or hallux. The most lateral digits on each side of the hand typically resemble fifth fingers/toes.,Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010442	HP_0010689	Mirror image duplication of digits

Fetal choroid plexus cysts	Fetal choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) are sonographically discrete, small cysts found in the choroid plexus within the lateral cerebral ventricles of the developing fetus at 14 to 24 weeks gestation. Imaging of the choroid plexus is performed in the transverse plane of the fetal head at the same level that the lateral cerebral ventricle is evaluated. The choroid plexus should be inspected bilaterally for the presence of cysts. The size of CPCs is not of clinical relevance (pmid:16100637).,There is agreement that ultrasound characteristics of CPC, such as bilaterality, size, number, complexity, and resolution, are not related to the risk of aneuploidy. However, cysts with diameters less than 5 mm may not be linked with trisomy and large cysts in excess of 10 mm may impart a higher risk.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011425	HP_0011426

Abnormal ciliary motility	Any anomaly of the normal motility of motile cilia. Evaluation of ciliary beat frequency and ciliary beat pattern requires high-speed videomicroscopy of freshly obtained ciliary biopsies that are maintained in culture media under controlled conditions.,Ciliated epithelial cells bear approximately 200 motile (9 + 2) cilia that move with both intracellular and intercellular synchrony. The pattern of beat in 9 + 2 motile cilia occurs in a waveform having a forward effective stroke followed by a return stroke. The direction of stroke is a function of the directional orientation of the central microtubules. In addition to moving in synchrony, individual cilia in normal cells are very plastic and move fluidly, sometimes deforming briefly upon encountering resistance and/or particles being transported over the mucosal surface. Cilia are embedded in a watery periciliary fluid of low viscosity, which facilitates the rapid beat cycle to move the more viscous overlying layer of mucus. Ciliary beat frequency ranges from approximately 8-20 Hz under normal conditions but may be accelerated by exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012261	HP_0012262

Resistance to activated protein C	Poor anticoagulant response to activated protein C. A plasma is termed 'APC resistant' when the addition of exogenous APC fails to prolong its clotting time in an activated partial thromboplastin time assay.,The protein C pathway is a major anticoagulant mechanism that down-regulates the prothrombin- and intrinsic factor X (FX)-activating complexes via inactivation of their respective cofactors, activated factors V (FVa) and VIII (FVIIIa). Cofactor inactivation occurs by limited proteolysis at certain amino acid positions in FVa and in FVIIIa. These reactions are catalyzed by the serine protease activated protein C (APC) and stimulated by the APC cofactor protein S.

Abnormal bone ossification	Any anomaly in the formation of bone or of a bony substance, or the conversion of fibrous tissue or of cartilage into bone or a bony substance.,All bones are formed by the replacement by osteocytes of mesenchyme-derived connective tissue. Intramembranous ossification refers to the direct replacement of primitive mesenchyme with bone, and is responsible for bones such as the calvarium (e.g., frontals, parietals, interparietal) and the clavicula. In endochondral ossification, the mesenchyme differentiates into a cartilaginous intermediate, which serves as a template (anlange) that is subsequently removed and replaced by bone. Most bones are formed via endochondral ossification, including those at the base of the skull, the vertebral column, pectoral and pelvic regions and long bones of the extremities. A reduction in the amount of mineralized bone compared with that expected for a given developmental age. In clinicakl parlance, reduced ossification and delayed ossification are often used synonymously, but in principle a bone delayed ossification in a child can display normal ossification at a later developmental stage. The HPO will therefore treat poor, reduced, and decreased officiation as synonymous, and delayed ossification as a specific kind of reduced ossification.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003330	HP_0011849	Abnormal bone maturation

Skewed maternal X inactivation	A deviation from equal (50%) inactivation of each parental X chromosome in maternal cells.,X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the process by which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in females is inactivated in order to achieves dosage equivalency for X-linked genes between XY males and XX females. An individual cell's decision to inactivate either the paternal or maternal X is made early in development, at approximately the time of implantation, such that normally there is a roughly equal distribution of either X being active. A deviation from equality is known as skewing, with common criteria for "skewed" inactivation being arbitrarily defined as the observation of inactivation of the same allele in 75% or 80% of cells (and very skewed inactivation resulting in 90% or 95% of cells with the same allele inactive). For some X-linked diseases there is strong selection in the heterozygous carrier in favor of cells bearing the mutation on the silenced inactive X, and thus, assessment of XCI skewing in female family members can be suggestive of carrier status.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002686	HP_0012546

Infection due to encapsulated bacteria	An infection by an encapsulated bacterial agent. Isolates which cause invasive disease are usually surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, which is a major virulence factor and the key antigen in protective protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines.,Encapsulated bacteria have been responsible for the majority of bacteremia and meningitis in children for many decades. In children aged over 3 months, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), and Haemophilus influenzae have been the predominant pathogens, with H. influenzae being a less significant problem since the introduction of vaccines against type b organisms. Disease is most common in young children less than 5 years of age and older adults aged over 65 years. In neonates and young infants, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the major cause of bacteremia and meningitis. These organisms have the shared characteristic of being surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, which is a key virulence factor because it helps the bacteria evade complement deposition and subsequent phagocytosis and killing. These polysaccharides have also been the basis for successful vaccines against all except GBS, because immune responses against the polysaccharide capsule are the primary mechanism of protection for the human host.

Increased total iron binding capacity	An elevation in the total-iron binding capacity, which measures how much serum iron is bound if an excess of radioactive iron is added. A high TIBC corresponds to a high transferrin concentration. The latent (or free) iron binding capacity is the difference between the TIBC and the measured serum iron, corresponding to the transferrin not bound to iron, i.e., free iron binding capacity.,Iron is transported to body tissues by a protein, transferrin, in plasma. This protein has two high-affinity binding sites for iron. Determination of total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) of the plasma therefore gives a measure of transferrin, although it can also be directly determined. Virtually all plasma iron (P1) normally is bound to transferrin, and measurement of P1 is assumed to reflect the amount of transferrin iron. The expression transferrin saturation, expressed as percent [(P1/TIBC) x 100], indicates the availability of iron to tissues. As transferrin saturation increases, there is an increase in the amount of diferric transferrin, which has a greater capacity to deliver iron than does monoferric transferrin. Measurements of P1, TIBC, and transferrin saturation have served several purposes in clinical medicine. The P1 concentration and (particularly) transferrin saturation relect the adequacy of iron supply. A saturation of less than 16% indicates a deficient iron supply, whereas a saturation of over 60% as measured on more than one occasion represents excessive iron loading owing to increased iron absorption or liver disease. An increased transferrmn concentration as reflected in the TIBC indicates iron depletion if the effects of estrogen and pregnancyare excluded. Other characteristic changes inboth P1 and TIBC are useful in the differential diagnosis of various diseases, for example, the decrease in transferrin saturations associated with a decreased transferrin concentration in inflammatory states.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011031	HP_0025196

Noncompaction cardiomyopathy	A type of cardiomyopathy characterized anatomically by deep trabeculations in the ventricular wall, which define recesses communicating with the main ventricular chamber.,Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is a cardiomyopathy thought to be caused by arrest of normal embryogenesis of the endocardium and myocardium. This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development, the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses, or sinusoids, occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life, proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected, but biventricular noncompaction has been reported, with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle, several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction [pmid:15210614].	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001638	HP_0012817	Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium,Spongiform cardiomyopathy

Hallux rigidus	Osteoarthritis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe.,Hallux rigidus is characterised by arthralgia, which is usually worsened by walking. With time the joint enlarges and the symptoms become more pronounced with pain at the dorsal bony prominence of the first metatarsophalengeal joint (MTPJ) and decreased range of motion, especially dorsiflexion. In this process the destruction of the cartilage commonly starts at the dorsal portion of the metatarsal head and the bony prominence might impinge against the proximal phalanx.. Physical examination usually shows a painful, tender and swollen first MTPJ with limited motion and pain usually when dorsiflexed. Typical radiographic findings are asymmetric joint narrowing and a flattened metatarsal head. With advancement of the disease more of the joint surface is involved and subchondral cysts, sclerosis and bony proliferation at the joint margins occur and the joint narrowing progresses [PMID:24649409].	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001844	HP_0025004	Arthritis of the big toe

Endometriosis	The growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.,The main manifestations of endometriosis are chronic upper abdominal pain and infertility. Endometriosis occurs primarily on the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, and rectovaginal septum, and in rare cases on the diaphragm, pleura, and pericardium. Endometriosis affects 6 to 10% of women of reproductive age, 50 to 60% of women and teenage girls with pelvic pain, and up to 50% of women with infertility. Peritoneal disease, which is dependent on estrogen for growth, derives from retrograde menstruation of steroid hormone sensitive endometrial cells and tissues, which implant on peritoneal surfaces and elicit an inflammatory response.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia	An opportunistic disease caused by invasion of unicellular fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. Transmission of P. jirovecii cysts takes place through the airborne route, and usually, its presence in lungs is asymptomatic. However, people with impaired immunity, especially those with CD4+ T cell count below 200/microliter, are still at risk of the development of Pneumocystis pneumonia due to P. jirovecii invasion. Symptoms induced by this disease are not specific: progressive dyspnoea, non-productive cough, low-grade fever, arterial partial pressure of oxygen below 65 mmHg, and chest radiographs demonstrating bilateral, interstitial shadowing.,Pneumocystis, initially considered to be a protozoan, later has been assigned to the kingdom of fungi.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032255	HP_0020102

Abnormal CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell proportion	A deviation from the normal proportion of natural T regulatory cells (Treg) in the blood circulation. Natural Treg are characterised as expressing both the CD4 T cell co-receptor and CD25, which is a component of the IL-2 receptor. Treg are thus CD4+ CD25+. Expression of the nuclear transcription factor Forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) is the defining property which determines natural Treg development and function.,Identification of Treg cells remains problematic, because accumulating evidence suggests that all the presently-used Treg markers (CD25, CTLA-4, GITR, LAG-3, CD127 and Foxp3) represent general T-cell activation markers, rather than being truly Treg-specific.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025540	HP_0020111	
Persistent human papillomavirus infection	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small oncogenic viruses. HPV has been shown to cause a variety of lesions and malignancies, which predominantly affect the anogenital region. Low-risk, non-oncogenic HPV types are associated with anogenital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis while high-risk, oncogenic types are associated with cervical, penile, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers. Infection with anogenital HPV is usually asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously without consequences in the immunocompetent host. When disease does occur, the most common manifestation is genital warts, which may be small papules, or flat, smooth or pedunculated lesions. This resolution of HPV lesions is not generally seen in the immunosuppressed, resulting in severe, persistent and extensive manifestations of HPV disease.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032169	HP_0020114

Reduced reactive oxygen species production in neutrophils	Polymorphonuclear neutrophils comprise more than 60% ofthe circulating white blood cells in humans. They have a central role in innate immunity and they regulate adaptive immunity. In healthy individuals, circulating neutrophils are freely flowing in a resting, dormant state. Upon infection, neutrophils are the first circulating cells to arrive at the infection and inflammatory site. Phagocytosis triggers the activation program of the neutrophils, leading to the intraphagosomal release of antibacterial peptides, proteases, myeloperoxidase, and superoxide anion (O2-), which is produced via the activation of the NADPH oxidase. Superoxide anion is the initiating spark leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxylradical and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), all contributing to the death and destruction of the bacteria within the phagosome. ROS production by the phagocytes was first referred as the respiratory burst or oxidative burst due to the rapid and cyanide-insensitive increase in oxygen uptake, increase in glucose consumption, andimmediate ROS release. The enzyme system dedicated to superoxide anion production, i.e., the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a member of the NOX family of proteins also referred as NOX2, is composed of six proteins, two trans-membrane proteins (p22phox and gp91phox) that form theflavocytochrome b558, and four soluble proteins (p47phox,p67phox, and p40phox and the small G-proteins, Rac1/2).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025463	HP_0025632

Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003256	HP_0030780

Neurenteric cyst	The neurenteric cyst is a rare lesion composed of heterotopic endodermal tissue. During the third week of human embryogenesis, the neurenteric canal unites the yolk sac and the amniotic cavity as it traverses the primitive notochordal plate. Persistence of the normally transient neurenteric canal prevents appropriate separation of endoderm and notochord. This results in a variable degree of communication between neural and enteric epithelium.,Individuals diagnosed with neurenteric cysts most frequently present in the second and third decades of life with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 2:1. Moreover, in the pediatric population, 61.2 percent of patients found to have neurenteric cysts are male with a mean age of 6.4 years at presentation. The majority of adult patients with neurenteric cysts present with progressive focal pain at the level of spinal axis pathology, fluctuating myelopathic signs, or radicular symptoms.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030724	HP_0030725

Abnormal pancreatic duct morphology	Any structural anomaly of the pancreatic duct, which is the tubular structure that collects exocrine pancreatic secretions and and transports them to the duodenum.,The pancreas develops from dorsal and ventral buds that first appear in the fifth gestational week as outgrowths of the primitive foregut. By the seventh gestational week, expansion of the duodenum causes the ventral bud to rotate and pass behind the duodenum from right to left and fuse with the dorsal bud. The ventral bud forms the posterior head and uncinate process, whereas the dorsal bud forms the anterior head, body, and tail. Following this fusion, the ductal systems anastomose, a complicated process with a wide spectrum of possible outcomes. The portion of the ventral duct between the dorsal-ventral fusion and major papilla is termed the duct of Wirsung. The portion of the dorsal duct upstream to the dorsalventral fusion point is called the main pancreatic duct. The segment of the dorsal duct downstream to the dorsal-ventral fusion point is termed the duct of Santorini, or accessory pancreatic duct, which drains at the papilla minor [PMID:242655659].	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012090	HP_0030992

Abnormal serum bile acid concentration	A deviation from the normal concentration of serum bile acid concentration.,There are two major bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, which are synthesised in the hepatocyte by the cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. These bile acids are secreted into the biliary canaliculi as sodium salts and conjugated with glycine, taurine, sulphate or glucuronic acid, and stored in the gall bladder until excreted into the intestinal lumen in response to a fatty meal. Enterohepatic circulation of bile salts is associated with conversion of the primary bile salts to seconday bile salts by bacerial enyzmes. The total bile pool of about 4 grams is recirculated about 5 to 10 times per day. Because serum bile salt concentration can increase by two to five times after a meal it is important that bile salts are measured while the subject is fasting.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010996	HP_0030984

Twin-to-twin transfusion	As a result of sharing a single placenta, the blood supplies of monochorionic twin fetuses can become connected, so that they share blood circulation: although each fetus uses its own portion of the placenta, the connecting blood vessels within the placenta allow blood to pass from one twin to the other.Depending on the number, type and direction of the interconnecting blood vessels (anastomoses), blood can be transferred disproportionately from one twin (the donor) to the other (the recipient). This state of transfusion causes the donor twin to have decreased blood volume, retarding the donor's development and growth. The blood volume of the recipient twin is increased, which can strain the fetus's heart and eventually lead to heart failure.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001197	HP_0031110	Twin to twin transfusion syndrome

Retinal neovascularization	In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.,When traction retinal detachment involves the macula, which is responsible for reading and driving vision, severe visual loss occurs.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008046	HP_0030666	Retinal neovascularisation

Intraretinal haemorrhages may be 'dot' or' blot' shaped or flame shaped depending upon their depth within the retina.,Although the fundoscopic appearence of an intraretinal hemorrhage can exibit significant variability it can typically be distinguished from a subretinal hemorrhage (occuring between the neurosensory retina and the RPE) or a sub-ILM hemorrhage (occuring between the internal limiting membrane and the neurosensory retina).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000573	HP_0031805	
Archibald's sign	Shortening of the fourth and fifth metacarpals when the fist is clenched.,In 1959, Archibald, Finlay, and De Vito were the first to describe a sign that depended on the relative lengths of the lateral three metacarpals (the metacarpal finding). When a line is drawn tangentially to the circumference of the heads (distal ends) of the fourth and fifth metacarpals, the extension of this line normally passes distally to the head of the third metacarpal and does not intersect the third metacarpal (negative metacarpal finding). In some hands such a line is tangential also to the circumference of the head of the third metacarpal (borderline metacarpal finding). In others the line runs through the distal end of the third metacarpal (positive metacarpal finding).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005916	HP_0031809	Knuckle dimple,Archibald's metacarpal sign

Popliteal synovial cyst	A fluid-filled mass that is a distention of a preexisting bursa in the popliteal fossa, most commonly the gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa. This bursa is unique in that it communicates with the knee joint, unlike other periarticular bursae, via an opening in the joint capsule posterior to the medial femoral condyle.,Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are commonly found in association with intraarticular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears. Histologically, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue with fibrosis, and chronic nonspecific inflammation may be present. Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may also be found within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. Baker cysts can be a source of posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intraarticular lesion, and they are routinely discovered on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the symptomatic knee. Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin are infrequent and may be related to size.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002815	HP_0032072	Baker's cyst

Angel-shaped phalanx	A phalangeal malformation that is termed angel-shaped phalanx (ASP), because of its resemblance to the angels used for decoration of Christmas trees. The various components of an angel-shaped phalanx are: diaphyseal cuff (wings), surrounding a meta-diaphyseal core (body), which may appear empty or structured with a cone-shaped epiphysis (skirt) and pseudoepiphysis (head).,In some cases an ASP can grow into an inconspicuous brachydactyly after physeal closure.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005918	HP_0032078	
Translamellar mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation	A type of mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation in which the increase in mucoid extracellular matrix alters the arrangement of the lamellar units to varying degrees.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200146	HP_0032082	
Aortic elastic fiber fragmentation	Loss and/or fragmentation of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta creating increasingly extended translamellar spaces, with absence of elastic fibers, and increased gaps in elastic fiber lamellae as identified on a stain for elastic fibers.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032083	
Aortic elastic fiber thinning	A thinning out of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta that creates widening of intralamellar spaces, as identified on a stain for elastic fibers.,A healthy aorta has dense elastic fibers comprising each lamella. This term describes the elastic network as being thinned at each lamella with narrower and more frayed apart elastic fibers. This entity may be associated with an increase in extracellular matrix material in the lamellar unit. The use of an elastic stain is essential to identify this lesion.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032084	
Aortic elastic fiber disorganization	Nonparallel arrangement/disarray of elastic fibers of the media of the aorta as identified on a stain for elastic fibers.,This rarer process is distinct from fragmentation and loss as the fibers acquire a more haphazard, poorly organized appearance, with loss of the usual parallel/concentric arrangement of elastic fibers within the lamellar unit. This finding is noticeable when at high power, and the orientation of the lamellar units parallel to the aortic lumen is lost. The use of an elastic stain is essential to identify this lesion. Disorganization of elastic fibers can be seen in conjunction with smooth muscle cell disorganization. A poorly oriented aortic specimen may appear to have disorganization and should not be confused with the real entity. This rarer entity should be commented upon, when present as it represents a more severe feature of medial degeneration, but is not essential for routine surgical pathology reporting.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032085	
Intralamellar mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation	A type of mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation in which the increase in mucoid extracellular matrix does not significantly alter the arrangement of the lamellar units.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0200146	HP_0032081	
Aortic smooth muscle cell nuclei loss	A region of the aortic media in which smooth muscle cell nuclei, involving multiple lamellae, are not clearly identifiable on an hematoxylin and eosin stain.,Smooth muscle cell nuclei loss replaces terms such as medionecrosis and smooth muscle cell necrosis that implied a loss of smooth muscle cells. While the loss of a nucleus suggests the loss of the entire cell, this is not easily appreciated on an hematoxylin and eosin stain stain. The shorter term smooth muscle cell loss was also considered by the consensus group and had many proponents, but the addition of nuclei was ultimately favored by the majority mostly as a histologic definition. Smooth muscle cell nuclei can be lost in patches or can be lost in a band-like pattern. This lesion can be noted in the absence of laminar medial collapse, described below. Both stains highlighting collagen and SMA immunohistochemistry can be used to highlight smooth muscle cell changes.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032086	
Aortic laminar medial collapse	Architecturally, a compaction of aortic medial elastic fibers that creates thinning of the lamellar unit secondary to a band-like smooth muscle cell loss identified using a stain for elastic fibers.,Laminar medial collapse replaces the old term laminar medial necrosis and is to be used only when an elastic stain has demonstrated elastic fiber compaction. Laminar medial collapse appears as a darker band on an elastic stain as a result of a significant loss of intermixed smooth muscle cells.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032087	
Aortic smooth muscle cell disorganization	Nonparallel arrangement/disarray of smooth muscle cells of the aortic media creating focal/multifocal disarray or sometimes nodular aggregates of smooth muscle cells.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032088	
Aortic medial fibrosis	An increase in collagen fibers creating areas of substitutive fibrosis or a widening of intralamellar spaces in the media of the aorta. This can be seen in conjunction with a loss to varying degrees of parallel arrangement of the elastic lamellae (or lamellar units).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032079	HP_0032089	
Increased circulating surfactant protein level	An increased concentration of a surfactant protein in the blood circulation.,Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. Increased levels of serum SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D may reflect lung damage.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010876	HP_0032094	Increased serum surfactant protein level

Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction	Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction can occur at the valvular, subvalvular, or supravalvular level. In general, there is an obstruction to forward flow which increases afterload, and if untreated, can result in hypertrophy, dilatation, and eventual failure of the left ventricle.,Common causes of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction include subaortic stenosis, bicupsid aortic valve, supravalvar aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Note that we reserve this term to describe the physiological abnormality, and denote the morphological abnormalities that lead to LVOT obstruction in the corresponding Morphology sections of the HPO.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030872	HP_0032092

Impaired nasal mucociliary clearance	An abnormally increased amount of time required to clear mucus (and substances contained in the mucus) from the nasal mucosa. The nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) system functions to transport the mucous layer lining the nasal epithelium towards the naso pharynx by ciliary beating in a metachronous fashion at a frequency of 7-16 Hz. NMC depends upon two principal components: physicochemical qualities and quantities of mucus and the properties of cilia that propel it. NMC is considered to be representative of pulmonary clearance. normal NMC time is determined to be up to 20 minutes. Duration of 30 minutes is considered as the cutoff point that discriminates normal subjects from subjects with impaired NMC. NMC can be measured by determination of the transport time of markers that are placed on the nasal mucosa including saccharine, radioactive markers, and dyes.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031602	HP_0031603	Abnormal saccharine test

Tessier number 11 facial cleft	An upper medial orbital cleft produces a cleft of the medial one-third of the upper eyelid that extends through the eyebrow into the frontal hairline. The skeletal element of the cleft in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla may either pass lateral to the ethmoid, through the supraorbital rim, or it may pass through the ethmoidal labyrinth to produce orbital hypertelorism. This cleft usually accompanies the Number 3 cleft. The soft tissue features include a cleft of the medial portion of the upper eyelid, an irregularity in hair orientation at the medial end of the eyebrow, and a long tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline onto the forehead. There is a mild flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla and extensive pneumatization of both the ethmoidal and frontal sinuses, both of which are more prominent on the cleft side. No bony clefting of the supraorbital rim or frontal bone is evident. The cranial base and sphenoid architecture, including the pterygoid processes, are symmetric and normal.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031574	HP_0031583

Tessier number 10 facial cleft	In a Number 10 Tessier cleft there is an upper central orbital cleft with a cleft of the middle one-third of the upper eyelid, which often results in total ablepharia. The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve. The bony orbit is inferiorly displaced and widened with the lateral orbital wall shortened and laterally deviated. Similar distortion of the anterior cranial fossa is evident, being broader and more flattened on the affected side. The calvarium above the level of the cleft and the cranial base below is symmetric.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031574	HP_0031582	
Tessier number 9 facial cleft	This is an upper lateral orbital cleft. The soft tissue deformity is in the lateral one-third of the upper eyelid, and the bony cleft is through the superolateral orbital angle. Microphthalmia is present. The superolateral bony deficiency of the orbits allows a lateral displacement of the globes. The lateral one-third of the upper eyelid and the outer canthus are distorted, thus preventing apposition to the globe. The upper eyelid does not have a true cleft. A soft tissue furrow radiates superiorly and posterisphenoid is symmetric and normal. Mild cranial base asymmetry is reflected in the pterygoid plates. The left pair is more laterally displaced from the midline. Skull vault plagiocephaly is evident with an apparent reduction in the anteroposterior dimension of the anterior cranial fossa.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031574	HP_0031581

Tessier number 14 facial cleft	This midline cranial cleft usually occurs with a midline facial cleft that completes a median craniofacial dysraphia. A broad nasal root and bifid nose are associated with orbital hypertelorism and a median frontal encephalocele. The frontal bone abnormality varies from a minor flattening to a large midline defect. There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa. The floor of the anterior cranial fossa is upslanting from its medial aspect to its lateral aspect, with a harlequin appearance on the coronal scan.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100629	HP_0031586	
Jejunal arteriovenous malformation	An anomalous configuration of blood vessels that shunts arterial blood directly into veins without passing through the capillaries and that is located in the jejunum.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002629	HP_0031343	
Tessier number 13 facial cleft	There is a paramedian frontal encephalocele and a soft tissue cleft that passes medial to an intact eyebrow. The frontal bone shows a paramedian bony cleft with an associated encephalocele. The olfactory groove, cribriform plate, and ethmoid sinus are all increased in transverse diameter, resulting in hypertelorism. The cleft extends medially to the undisturbed eyebrow to end in a short paramedian frontal widow's peak. The bony cleft begins in the region of the nasal bone and extends superiorly through the full height of the frontal bone. Posteriorly, the cleft extends through the cribriform plate and ethmoid sinus as far as the lesser wing and body of the sphenoid. The pterygoid processes are anatomically normal, but they are displaced laterally from the midline on the cleft side. There is orbital hypertelorism below and asymmetry of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa above.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031571	HP_0031585	
Duodenal arteriovenous malformation	An anomalous configuration of blood vessels that shunts arterial blood directly into veins without passing through the capillaries and that is located in the duodenum.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002629	HP_0031342	
Tessier number 12 facial cleft	There is a soft tissue cleft medial to the inner canthus with a cleft of the root of the eyebrow. The frontal process of the maxilla is flat and broadened, and the ethmoid labyrinth is increased in tranverse dimension, thereby producing orbital hypertelorism. The cribriform plate is of normal width. The frontal sinus is enlarged. Even though the frontal bone is flattened, bony clefts with encephalocele have not been observed. There is a lateral displacement of the inner canthus with a mild thinning, aplasia, or irregularity of the medial end of the eyebrow. There are no eyelid clefts. The soft tissue contour of the forehead is normal, with only a short downward prolongation of the paramedian frontal hairline to mark the superior extent of the soft tissue cleft. Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse. The extensive pneumatization of the sinuses on the cleft side extends backward through the frontal and ethmoid sinuses and into the sphenoid sinus. The anatomy of the sphenoid, including the pterygoid processes, is otherwise normal. The anterior and middle cranial fossae floors are both broadened on the cleft side with minor widening of the cribriform plate.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031571	HP_0031584

Tessier number 7 facial cleft	The temporozygomatic Number 7 cleft is found in both Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia. Soft tissue manifestations include macrostomia, malformations of the external and middle ear, temporalis muscle, variable involvement of the seventh cranial nerve (in hemifacial microsomia), and abnormalities of the preauricular hair in Treacher Collins syndrome. The skeletal cleft is through the pterygomaxillary junction, and vertical maxillary hypoplasia is present. In addition, abnormality of the mandibular ramus, coronoid, and condyle and absence of the zygomatic arch are typically present. A soft tissue furrow extends from the macrostomia laterally and superiorly across the cheek toward the preauricular hairline. The lower eyelids are intact. The anatomy of the external ear is normal, and there are no preauricular tags. Bony clefting is through the pterygomaxillary junction with hypoplasia of the alveolar process in the molar region, thereby producing a posterior open bite. The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric. There is no antegonial notching of the mandible. Marked cranial base asymmetry, with tilting and asymmetric positioning of the temporomandibular articulations, is present. The anatomy of the sphenoid is abnormal, especially on the right where there is no recognizable medial or lateral pterygoid plate.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100731	HP_0031579

Tessier number 5 facial cleft	The cleft of the lip is just medial to the oral commissure and extends across the cheek as a furrow. It ends as a cleft at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the lower eyelid. Microphthalmia is frequently present. The alveolar cleft is through the premolar region and extends superiorly through the orbit at the inferolateral part of the rim and floor. There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The right-sided pterygoid plates are smaller and closer to the midline. There is minimal asymmetry of the cranial base and calvarium.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031574	HP_0031577	
Abnormal cadiomyocyte dystrophin staining	Anomalous staining of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes.,Dystrophin, a 427-kD cytoskeletal protein, is a member of the beta-spectrin/alpha-actinin protein family.

Abnormal PR interval	An anomaly of the PR interval, which is the portion of the ECG from the end of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. A normal PR interval in adults is from 0.12-0.2 seconds.,The PR interval begins at the onset of the P wave and ends at the onset of the QRS complex. This interval reflects the time the impulse takes to reach the ventricles from the sinus node. In contrast, the PR segment begins at the endpoint of the P wave and ends at the onset of the QRS complex. It reflects the conduction from the atrioventricular node, down the bundle of His and through the bundle branches to the muscle.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003115	HP_0031593

Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia	Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is widely accepted as the precursor lesion of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). VSCC arises via either a human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated pathway, or more commonly, via a mechanism independent of HPV, often being linked to chronic inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (LS). Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS. As a result, dVIN is rarely identified in advance of a diagnosis of invasive malignancy, despite being the precursor lesion of the majority of VSCC.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030416	HP_0032202	
Enlarged Eustachian valve	An abnormally large Eustachian valve (postnatally). The Eustachian valve is also known as the valve of the inferior vena cava, and is an embryologic remnant of the valve of the inferior vena cava.,During fetal life, the eustachian valve directs oxygen-rich blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC) toward the foramen ovale and away from the tricuspid valve. After the closure of the foramen ovale, it does not have a specific function. In echocardiographic examinations, the eustachian valve may appear as a thin flap originating from the orifice of the IVC, or it may be totally absent. Sometimes it may appear as a rigid, elongated structure in the inferior portion of the right atrium or as a membranous, undulating, echogenic mass within the right atrial cavity.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025576	HP_0031591	Enlarged inferior vena cava valve,Giant Eustachian valve
Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia	Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) of the terminal ileum and colon has been considered a mucosal response to nonspecific stimuli, most often infections, and consequently has been regarded as a pathophysiologic phenomenon during infancy and childhood. LNH can be ascertained by colonoscopy, whereby a lymphoid nodule is defined as an extruding follicle with a diameter of not more than 2 mm, and LNH is defined as a cluster of not more than 10 of such extruding lymphoid nodules (see Figure 1 of PMID:17368236).,The presence of LNH in the mucosa of the colon and/or terminal ileum is a frequent finding (30%) in children undergoing colonoscopy. Unless associated with other endoscopic lesions, LNH is mostly related to a condition of delayed-type food hypersensitivity and affects mainly preschool or school-age children with hematochezia.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002250	HP_0032203	Lymphonodular hyperplasia of the colon

Abnormal sebaceous gland morphology	Any structural anomaly of the sebaceous glands.,Sebaceous glands are found all over the human body except on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The glands are numerous on the face and scalp and are sparse in areas such as the back. They can number as many as 400-900 glands/cm2 on the face. Sebaceous glands are usually found in association with a hair follicle, which, together, is referred to as a pilosebaceous unit. The sebaceous gland is located in association with the upper portion of the hair follicle, where it is not affected by the hair cycle. Sebaceous glands can be unilobular or multilobular. Although a majority of sebaceous glands are part of a pilosebaceous unit, some glands can be found without an associated hair follicle. Sebaceous glands secrete sebum, which contains cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, squalene, fatty acids, diglycerides and triglycerides, and wax esters.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011138	HP_0032226

Abnormal proportion of naive T cells	Any abnormality in the proportion of naive T cells relative to the total number of T cells.,Following the development of T cells in the thymus, they enter the blood stream and recirculate between the blood and peripheral lymphatic tissues. Mature recirculating T cells that have not yet encountered their specific antigen are known as naive T cells. Mature T cell not yet exposed to antigen with the phenotype CCR7-positive, CD45RA-positive, and CD127-positive. This cell type is also described as being CD25-negative, CD62L-high and CD44-low. Human mature CD4+ T cells are functionally heterogeneous and can be divided into naive and memory/effector populations based on the expression of cell surface markers. Although the most significant differences between these two populations are functional, the leukocyte common Ag (CD45) was promoted as a potential marker of memory T cells. CD45 Ag may be found in various isoforms depending on alternative splicing of three extracellularly expressed exons. The expression of the highest molecular weight isoform, referred to as CD45RA, defines the population of CD4+ unprimed lymphocytes. Activation of naive lymphocytes through TCR engagement is followed by loss of CD45RA Ag and transition to the expression of the smallest molecular weight isoform CD45RO. These primed cells express high levels of activation Ags, acquire effector functions, and need less costimuli requirements for further activation.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025540	HP_0031396	Abnormal naive T cell proportion

Histoplamsosis	Histoplasmosis is caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum and is consider to be an opportunistic infection in immunosuppressed persons.,Most patients exhibit pulmonary signs and symptoms, accompanied by radiographic abnormalities, which often are mistaken for community-acquired pneumonia caused by bacterial or viral agents. Most of the infected individuals remain asymptomatic or have very mild illness that does not get diagnosed as histoplasmosis. Significant symptoms develop in less than 1% of patients and most frequently present as pulmonary or disseminated histoplasmosis. Immunocompromised individuals, including patients with AIDS, hematologic malignancies, transplant recipients, and patients receiving prolonged steroids, are at higher risk of developing acute disseminated disease with a rapid and aggressive course.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032255	HP_0032256

Disseminated histoplasmosis can involve various organs, including reticuloendothelial organs, gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands, central nervous system, endovascular structures, kidney, and skin. It typically presents with systemic symptoms like fever, generalized fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and the symptoms related to the specific organ involved. Severe disseminated disease can manifest as septic shock, multi organ failure, and ARDS.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032256	HP_0032257

Basic constant exotropia	Constant exotropia for near and distance, presenting after 6 months of age.,Typically infantile constant exotropia suggests presentation at 6 months of age or younger, while basic constant exotropia suggests later presentation (older than 6-12 months). (OHO 745 & 750).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031713	HP_0032010	Basic (constant) exotropia
Granuloma	A compact, organized collection of mature mononuclear phagocytes, which may be but is not necessarily accompanied by accessory features such as necrosis.,Granulomas vary considerably in their degree of complexity, physical size and organization. Not surprisingly, their classification has attracted much attention, and a numbers of schemes have been described. The cornerstone of the granulomatous response, however, is the predominant involvement of mononuclear phagocytes. As granulomas develop, tissue-resident, as well as inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes become intimately acquainted, and these cells may develop highly differentiated epithelioid cell characteristics. In many cases, elegant multinucleate populations can be seen, distinct from the syncytia formed after viral infection as evident by their extended life-span. Accumulating lymphocytes, mainly T cells, contribute to the developing microarchitecture of the granuloma, often with characteristic patterns of subset organization relative to the core of mononuclear phagocytes and to each other. B lymphocytes, plasma cells, NK cells and neutrophils may all be present, though a relative paucity of neutrophils delineates these sites of inflammation from those associated with necrosis. At its extreme, the granuloma may serve as the focus for irreversible fibrotic reactions, but, even in less dramatic cases, a substantive degree of local tissue remodelling occurs.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032251	HP_0032252	
Heterophoria	Heterophorias are latent deviations that are controlled by fusion. In certain circumstances (specific visual tasks, fatigue, illness, etc.), fusion can no longer be maintained and decompensation occurs.,In contrast to heterophoria, heterotropias are manifest deviations. Some individuals may be phoric in one situation (e.g. for distance) and tropic in another (e.g. for near). The distinction between heterotropia and heterophoria is that heterotropia refers to a misalignment of the eyes when the affected individual is looking at an object while the eyes are uncovered whereas heterophoria is a misalignment that is observed only when the two eyes are no longer looking at the same object. The monocular cover-uncover test is the most important test for detecting the presence of manifest strabismus and for differentiating a heterophoria from a heterotropia.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486	HP_0032011	
Eosinophilic granuloma	A type of granuloma characterized morphologically by the predominance of Langerhans cells with characteristic grooved, folded, indented nuclei in the appropriate milieu that includes variable numbers of eosinophils and histiocytes including multinucleated forms, often appearing similar to osteoclasts or touton like giant cells, neutrophils and small lymphocytes. The concentration of the eosinophilic infiltrate varies from scattered mature cells to sheet-like masses of cells. Occasionally, areas of bone necrosis may interrupt the cellular infiltrate. The foamy cells may also be amassed in clumps, which are of no clinical significance because these clumps represent phagocytosis of lipid debris.,Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is a benign disorder that affects children and young adults, particularly males. Solitary EG accounts for the majority of  Langerhans cell histiocytosis cases, usually involving bone and less commonly the lymph nodes, lung or skin.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032252	HP_0032253	
Heterotropia	Manifest deviation of the visual axes not controlled by fusion.,The distinction between heterotropia and heterophoria is that heterotropia refers to a misalignment of the eyes when the affected individual is looking at an object while the eyes are uncovered whereas heterophoria is a misalignment that is observed only when the two eyes are no longer looking at the same object. The monocular cover-uncover test is the most important test for detecting the presence of manifest strabismus and for differentiating a heterophoria from a heterotropia.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000486	HP_0032012

Empty delta sign	This sign is created by a nonenhancing thrombus in the dural sinus surrounded by triangular enhancing dura as seen on cross-section. The sign, seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan images, suggests dural sinovenous thrombosis. It is best seen on wider window settings. It is a reliable sign of sinus thrombosis but is seen only in 25-30% of these cases.,The use of multislice contrast-enhanced CT scan, with reconstructions into thinner slices in different planes, markedly improves the yield. The sign may not be seen in the early stage (less than 5 days) of thrombosis, as the fresh clot is hyperdense, or in the late stage (after more than 2 months), as numerous channels of recanalization develop in the thrombus after 2 months.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010303	HP_0032267	
Anetoderma	Circumscribed area of flaccid skin due to the loss of elastic tissue in the dermis.,Anetoderma is a skin disorder characterized by focal loss of dermal elastic tissue.

Lemon sign	This sign represents the loss of the normal convex contour of the frontal bones, with flattening or inward scalloping, seen on a transverse fetal sonogram obtained at the biparietal diameter level. It has a strong association with spina bifida and is very useful for detecting this condition before 24 weeks of gestation in high-risk patients. It has high sensitivity and specificity. The lemon sign may disappear as gestational age advances and hence it is less reliable after 24 weeks. The sign is not specific for spina bifida and has also been seen in encephalocele, Dandy-Walker malformation with encephalocele, thanatophoric dysplasia, cystic hygroma, diaphragmatic hernia, corpus callosal agenesis, hydronephrosis, and umbilical vein varix.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001197	HP_0032269

Sputum eosinophilia	An increased proportion of eosinophils in sputum in the differentiated cell count.,Sputum eosinophilia can be measured in various ways including measuing the mean percentage of eosinophils in the cell count of sputum induced by application of saline. The threshold chosen differs between studies, typically ranging from 1.25 to 3 percent. Increased sputum eosinophil counts may indicate a risk for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe asthma.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032016	HP_0032017	
Chronic tinea infection	The term tinea means fungal infection, whereas dermatophyte refers to the fungal organisms that cause tinea. This term refers to a tinea infection that is chronic or recalcitrant to treatment and may be reflective of an immune defect.,Tinea is usually followed by a Latin term that designates the involved site, such as tinea corporis and tinea pedis. Tinea versicolor (now called pityriasis versicolor) is not caused by dermatophytes but rather by yeasts of the genus Malassezia. Tinea unguium is more commonly known as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes are usually limited to involvement of hair, nails, and stratum corneum, which are inhospitable to other infectious agents. Dermatophytes include three genera: Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031035	HP_0032259

Muscle eosinophilia	Eosinophil infiltration of skeletal muscle.,This phenotype can be measured by determining the number and location of eosinophils in skeletal muscle biopsies by Giemsa and modified hematoxylin/eosin staining. However, infiltrating eosinophils are not always identified in conventional muscle histologic examination, but the eosinophil major basic protein, whose extracellular diffusion is considered a hallmark of eosinophilic cytotoxicity, is usually detected by immunostaining in muscle biopsy.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011805	HP_0032019	Eosinophilic infiltration of skeletal muscle
Abnormal circulating selenium concentration	Any deviation from the normal circulating concentration of selenium.,Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient that exists in the form of selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid, upon its incorporation into selenoproteins via the tRNA[Sec] encoded by Trsp. Dietary intake of the micronutrient selenium is essential for normal immune functions. Selenium is cotranslationally incorporated as the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, into selenoproteins that function to modulate pathways involved in inflammation.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032180	HP_0031903	Abnormal serum selenium concentration

Abnormal serum mast cell beta-tryptase concentration	Any deviation from the normal circulating concentration of mast cell beta-tryptase concentration.,Mast cells, which are granulocytes found in peripheral tissue, play a central role in inflammatory and immediate allergic reactions. Beta-Tryptase is a neutral serine protease and is the most abundant mediator stored in mast cell granules. The release of beta-tryptase from the secretory granules is a characteristic feature of mast cell degranulation. Mast cell beta-tryptase has an important role in inflammation and serves as a marker of mast cell activation. Beta-Tryptase activates the protease activated receptor type 2. It is involved in airway homeostasis, vascular relaxation and contraction, gastrointestinal smooth muscle activity and intestinal transport, and coagulation. Serum mast cell beta-tryptase concentration is increased in anaphylaxis and in other allergic conditions.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012379	HP_0031900	
Anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody positivity	The presence of M2 nti-mitochondrial antibody (immunoglobulins) in the serum.,Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) can be tested via indirect immunofluorescence. The auto-antigens of AMA have been identified as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2 (PDC-E2), branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex and 2-oxoglutaric acid dehydrogenase complex. The antibody to these antigens is known as AMA-M2. AMA-M2 is more specific to PBC than AMA, and the determination of its titer is feasible	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030057	HP_0031907	AMA-M2 positive

Unicornuate uterus	A uterus that has a single horn, with a banana-like shape that may or may not have a secondary rudimentary uterine horn.,A unicornuate uterus with a rudimentary horn is an anomaly caused by defective fusion of one of the paired Mullerian ducts. The incidence of rudimentary-horn pregnancy is estimated to be one in 76,000 pregnancies. Life-threateningly heavy bleeding and abortion are the anticipated outcomes of rudimentary horn pregnancies. According to the literature, the newborn survival rate is between 0-13 percent in pregnancies in the rudimentary horn, with only one third of such gestations reaching term or beyond. Slightly more than half of the pregnancies ended with a rupture of the pregnant uterine horn.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031105	HP_0031909

Perivascular pseudorosette	A type of rosette in which a spoke-wheel arrangement of cells with tapered cellular processes radiates around a wall of a centrally placed vessel.,The modifier pseudo differentiates this pattern from the Homer Wright and Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, perhaps because the central structure is not actually formed by the tumor itself, but instead represents a native, non-neoplastic element. Also, some early investigators argued about the definition of a central lumen, choosing pseudo to indicate that the hub was not a true lumen but contained structures. Nevertheless, this pattern remains extremely diagnostically useful and the modifier unnecessarily leads to confusion. Perivascular pseudorosettes are encountered in most ependymomas regardless of grade or variant.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031925	HP_0031929	
True ependymal rosette	A type of rosette in which a halo of cells surrounds an empty lumen.,In contrast to the Homer Wright and the Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, the empty-appearing lumen of the true ependymal rosette resembles a tubule lumen and contains no fiber-rich neuropil or central cytoplasmic projections. These tubule-like structures, as well as more elongated versions known as ependymal canals, may represent an attempt by the tumor cells to recapitulate the formation of ventricles with ependymal linings.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031925	HP_0031928	
Homer Wright rosette	A type of rosette in which the central lumen or hub is filled with fiber-like processes.,The delicate fibrillary material found within the central lumen of the Homer Wright rosette is composed of neuropil, which contains primitive neuronal processes or neurites. The typical Homer Wright rosette with its central lumen or hub filled with fiber-like processes can also be found in medulloblastomas and histologically similar tumors occurring outside of the cerebellum, designated PNETs.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031925	HP_0031926	
Hydatidiform mole	Hydatidiform mole (HM) is an aberrant human pregnancy with absence of, or abnormal embryonic development, hydropic degeneration of chorionic villi, and excessive proliferation of the trophoblast.,The hydatidiform mole (HM) is a placental pathology of androgenetic origin. Placental villi have an abnormal hyperproliferation event and hydropic degeneration. Three situations can be envisaged at its origin: 1. The destruction/expulsion of the female pronucleus at the time of fertilization by 1 or 2 spermatozoa with the former being followed by an endoreplication of the male pronucleus leading to a complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) 2. A triploid zygote (fertilization by 2 spermatozoa) leading to a partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) but can also lead to haploid and diploid clones. The diploid clone may produce a normal fetus while the haploid clone after endoreplication generates a CHM 3. A nutritional defect during the differentiation of the oocytes or the deterioration of the limited oxygen pressure during the first trimester of gestation may lead to the formation of a HM.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001194	HP_0032192	
Decreased low-density lipoprotein particle size	An abnormal decrease in the average size of low-density lipoprotein particle size in the blood circulation.,Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. LDL particles are the major cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins in the blood circulation, consisting of a hydrophobic core of cholesterol esters and triglycerides surrounded by phospholipds, free cholesterol, and one molecule of apolipoprotein B-100 on the surface of the molecule. The LDL particle population is heterogeneous with the respect to size, density and composition. Distinct subpopulations vary in isoelectric point, electrical charge, hydrodynamic properties and immunoreactivity.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003107	HP_0032193

Abnormal meniscus morphology	Abnormal structure of the meniscus of the knee, two crescent shape fibrocartilaginous pads that disperse the weight of the body and reduce friction of the knee joint during movement.,The meniscus is a fibrocartilaginous structure of the knee joint that enables the even distribution of a weight-bearing load across the articular surfaces. The menisci bear between 40 to 70% of the load across the knee, and the rest of the load is transmitted directly to the articular cartilage.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002815	HP_0032190	
Torn meniscus	A tear in the cartilaginous pad (meniscus) of the knee.,Not all meniscal injuries require surgery. Some of them have the ability to heal. The meniscal tear pattern and the presence of adequate vascularity are both key points. Tears within 3 mm of the meniscosynovial junction usually have an adequate blood supply that allows healing. Tears of 5 mm or more from this junction are considered avascular and need surgical intervention.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032190	HP_0032191

Abnormal serum anion gap	Any deviation from the normal value of the serum anion gap, which is calculated from the electrolytes measured in the chemical laboratory, is defined as the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations subtracted from the serum sodium concentration.,The determination of the anion gap is used in the detection and analysis of acid-base disorders, assessment of quality control in the chemical laboratory, and detection of such disorders as multiple myeloma, bromide intoxication, and lithium intoxication. The normal value can vary widely, reflecting both differences in the methods that are used to measure its constituents and substantial interindividual variability.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004360	HP_0031961	
Arm dystonia	A type of dystonia (abnormally increased muscular tone causing fixed abnormal postures) that affects muscles of the arms.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002451	HP_0031960	
Dystonic gait	Dystonic gait disorders frequently appear bizarre, particularly because activity increases dystonic tonus and posture. The abnormal posture of the foot in dystonic gait typically involves inversion, plantar flexion and tonic extension of the big toe. In many patients complex types of walking, such as walking backwards and running are paradoxically less impaired than walking forward and may seem completely unaffected. Sensory tricks, for instance, if the affected individual rests a hand on his or her neck, may improve or even normalize dystonic gait in some patients.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288	HP_0031954	
Asymmetric abdominal aortic aneurysm	An abdominal aortic aneurysm that is not symmetric around its axis (not axisymmetric).,Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in an advanced stage of development are truly asymmetric, due to the presence of tissue surrounding the abdominal aorta and to the vertebral column located posterior to this artery segment. This makes a large AAA less fusiform and to grow apart from the centerline of the lumen, accounting for a major anterior dilation and a more flat posterior surface.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0005112	HP_0031711	
Cautious gait	Cautious gait refers to an excessive degree of age-related changes in walking and fear of falling. The walking difficulties seem out of proportion when considering the patient's actual sensory or motor deficits. The gait appears slow, with a wider base than normal, reduced arm swing bilaterally and a slightly stooped posture. This type of gait change often occurs after the first time a patient has fallen.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288	HP_0031953	Senile gait
Compensatory head tilt to the left shoulder	A tendency to tilt the head towards the left shoulder to compensate for a limitation of eye movement.,With fourth cranial nerve palsy leading to weakness of the superior oblique muscle, affected persons tilt the head away from the affected eye as both eyes are most straight in this position.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031705	HP_0031710	
Neurogenic claudication	Lumbar spinal stenoses may induce symptoms following an individually typical latency on standing or when walking due to swelling of the cauda equina, which leads to compression. This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. The symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can be explained by an increase in lumbar lordosis and spinal canal stenosis in an upright position compared to the sitting position or if spondylolisthesis is present by a shift of the vertebrae while standing and walking. Following an individually characteristic distance, walking becomes associated with deep muscular pain and with neurological deficits, such as sensory deficits and paresis in the lower limbs, which resolve within minutes when the affected person sits or lies down. Activities performed in a flexed posture, such as cycling often cause less problems than walking. For the same reason, walking uphill may be tolerated better than walking downhill. Clinical neurological examination at rest may be entirely normal but there is usually pain on hyperextension of the lumbar spine.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001288	HP_0031952

Spastic paraparetic gait	A type of spastic gait in which the legs are usually slightly bent at the hip and in an adducted position. The knees are extended or slightly bent and the feet are in a plantar flexion position. This posture requires circumduction of the legs during walking. The gait may appear stiff (spastic gait disorder) or stiff as well as insecure (spastic ataxic gait disorder). In spastic paraparetic gait, each leg appears to be dragged forward. If the muscle tone in the adductors is marked, the resulting gait disorder is referred to as scissor gait.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002064	HP_0031958	
Near exotropia	An intermittent exotropia where there is binocular single vision on distance fixation and exotropia at near (intermittent or constant).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000577	HP_0031715	
Spastic hemiparetic gait	Spastic hemiparesis is characterized by a dominance of the tonus in the upper limb flexor muscles: the arm is held in an adducted posture and is bent and rotated inwards, the forearm is pronated and the hand and the fingers are flexed. The leg is slightly bent at the hip, the knee cannot be extended fully at the end of the stance phase and the foot is inverted and in a plantar flexed position. Gait is slow, with a wide base and asymmetrical with a shortened weight-bearing phase on the paretic side. During the swing phase, the paretic leg performs a lateral movement (circumduction) which is characteristic of this gait disorder, also termed Wernicke-Mann gait. Spastic gait problems typically worsen on attempts to walk faster.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002064	HP_0031957	Wernicke-Mann gait

Increased RBC distribution width	Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter of the standard full blood count and a measure of heterogeneity in the size of circulating erythrocytes. It is provided by automated hematology analyzers and it reflects the range of the red cell size. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of erythrocyte volume by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage.,Although RDW has been traditionally used in the investigation of the etiology of anemia there is an increasing evidence linking elevated RDW with poor outcome in general population [4, 5], in patients with coronary artery disease, with metabolic syndrome and heart failure.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001877	HP_0031965	Increased red blood cell distribution width

Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase	An abnormally high concentration in the circulation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of amino groups to form the hepatic metabolite oxaloacetate. ALT is found abundantly in the cytosol of the hepatocyte. ALT activity in the liver is about 3000 times that of serum activity. Thus, in the case of hepatocellular injury or death, release of ALT from damaged liver cells increases measured ALT activity in the serum. Although it is generally thought to be specific to the liver, it is also found in the kidney, and, in much smaller quantities, in heart and skeletal muscle cells.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002910	HP_0031964	Elevated serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase,Elevated serum ALT,Alanine aminotransferase increased

Increased circulating procalcitonin level	An elevated concentration of procalcitonin in the blood circulation.,Procalcitonin is a 116 amino acid peptide that has an approximate MW of 14.5 kDa and belongs to the calcitonin (CT) superfamily of peptides. It can be divided into 3 sections including the amino terminus of the PCT region, immature calcitonin, and calcitonin carboxyl-terminus peptide-1 (CCP-1). Procalcitonin is encoded by CALC-1 gene located on chromosome 11. Cleavage in 1 site of the primary transcript of CALC-1 gene produces pre-PCT, which further undergoes proteolytic cleavage of its signal sequence to produce PCT. The synthesized PCT then undergoes post-translational processing to produce small peptides and mature CT. PCT is a biomarker that exhibits greater specificity than other proinflammatory markers (eg, cytokines) in identifying patients with sepsis and can be used in the diagnosis of bacterial infections. The short half-life (25-30 hours in plasma) of PCT, coupled with its virtual absence in health and specificity for bacterial infections, gives it a clear advantage over the other markers of bacterial infection.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100530	HP_0032308

Abnormally loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound	The pulmonic component is considered to be abnormally loud in a subject over age 20 if it is greater than the aortic component in the second left ICS or if it is audible at the cardiac apex. This may be due either to pulmonary artery hypertension or right ventricular dilatation, with part of the right ventricle assuming the position normally occupied by the left ventricle. A split second sound at the apex is, therefore, definitely abnormal. The loud P2 commonly heard at the apex in patients with atrial septal defect is probably due to a dilated right ventricle encroaching upon the cardiac apex [source-NCBI:NBK341].	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031661	HP_0031687	Accentuation of the pulmonic component of the second heart sound

Clostridium difficile enteritis	An infection of the small intestine (enteritis) by clostridium difficile.,Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a common nosocomial infection caused by a gram-negative spore forming organism that most commonly leads to pseudomembranous colitis. Certain individuals are able to mount an effective immunoglobulin G response against C. difficile toxin A. This humoral immune response against the C. difficile toxin is believed to allow an individual to become an asymptomatic carrier. In contrast, people who fail to mount an immune response to C. difficile toxin are susceptible to infection. In general, patients on immunosuppressive therapy have a blunted ability to mount immune responses and, therefore, may be at greater risk for infection.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032166	HP_0032167	C. difficile enteritis

Molluscum contagiosum	Molluscum contagiosum is a cutaneous viral infection that is commonly observed in both healthy and immunocompromised children. The infection is caused by a member of the Poxviridae family, the molluscum contagiosum virus. Molluscum contagiosum presents as single or multiple small white or flesh-colored papules that typically have a central umbilication. The central umbilication may be difficult to observe in young children and, instead, may bear an appearance similar to an acneiform eruption. The lesions vary in size (from 1 mm to 1 cm in diameter) and are painless, although a subset of patients report pruritus in the area of infection. On average, 11-20 papules appear on the body during the course of infection and generally remains a self-limiting disease. However, in immunosuppressed patients, molluscum contagiosum can be a severe infection with hundreds of lesions developing on the body. Extensive eruption is indicative of an advanced immunodeficiency state.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032162	HP_0032163

Placental mesenchymal dysplasia	Placental mesenchymal dysplasia is an abnormality of the stem villi of the placenta that may be mistaken for a hydatidiform mole, and in particular, partial mole, owing to the mixture of cysts and normal-appearing parenchyma. The stem (anchoring) villi form as outgrowths of the chorionic plate early in placentogenesis and give rise to the branching villous trees.,Histologically, placental mesenchymal dysplas (PMD) shows enlarged edematous stem villi with dilated vessels and absent trophoblastic proliferation. Cisterns may be seen within stem villi. The vessels are thick walled, with fibromuscular hyperplasia. Terminal villi are usually normal. The edematous stem villous stroma stains for Alcian blue, but is negative for smooth muscle actin, which shows positive staining of normal villous stroma. Staining for desmin and vimentin is retained in PMD, similarly to normal villous stroma.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100767	HP_0032165

Severe infection is characterized by manifestions including VZV pneumonia, hepatitis, meningitis, and disseminated varicella.,Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is one of eight herpes viruses known to cause human infection and is distributed worldwide. Varicella zoster infections are considered to be mild and ubiquitous infections predominantly affecting the paediatric population. However, in adults and in specific groups of patients, such as those who are immunosuppressed, varicella infections can be fulminant and life threatening.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031691	HP_0032170

This sign is considered a good marker of immune activity as it is seen when the necrotic tissue gets invaded by leukocytes and replaced by air in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Other conditions in which air crescent sign can be seen are pulmonary gangrene, pulmonary hematoma, Rasmussen aneurysm in a tuberculous cavity, and lung hydatid.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031983	HP_0032172	
Continuous diaphragm sign	This sign is seen in pneumomediastinum in which air accumulates between the lower border of the heart and the superior part of the diaphragm, which results in complete visualization of the diaphragm in chest X-ray, hence named continuous diaphragm sign.,Normally, the central part of the diaphragm is obscured by the heart, and hence is not seen on chest radiographs. Though this sign is commonly seen in pneumomediastinum, it can occasionally be also seen in pneumopericardium. This sign when seen, is a differential tool between pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031983	HP_0032173	
Flaky paint dermatosis	A dermatosis characterized by generalized shiny, enamel-like, hyperpigmented scales in an irregular pattern. The scales may peel or desquamate, rather like old, sun-baked blistered paint, often with areas of underlying hypopigmentation.

Abnormal circulating globulin level	An abnormal concentration of globulins in the blood. Albumin makes up more than half of the total protein present in serum. The remaining blood proteins except albumin and fibrinogen (which is not in serum) are referred to as globulins. The globulin fraction includes hundreds of serum proteins including carrier proteins, enzymes, complement, and immunoglobulins. Most of these are synthesized in the liver, although the immunoglobulins are synthesized by plasma cells. Globulins are divided into four groups by electrophoresis. The four fractions are alpha1, alpha2, beta and gamma, depending on their migratory pattern between the anode and the cathode.,Any increase or decrease in the globulin fraction should be evaluated by serum electrophoresis. The alpha1 fraction consists mainly of alpha1 antitrypsin, which is an acute phase reactant that goes up in acute inflammation. The alpha1 fraction is reduced in congenital alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency. The alpha2 region consists mainly of alpha2 macroglobulin and haptoglobin. The major beta globulin is transferring. Elevations can occur in severe iron deficiency.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010876	HP_0032179

Apical pulmonary opacity	An apical cap is a caplike lesion at the lung apex, usually caused by intrapulmonary and pleural fibrosis pulling down extrapleural fat or possibly by chronic ischemia resulting in hyaline plaque formation on the visceral pleura. The prevalence increases with age. It can also be seen in hematoma resulting from aortic rupture or in other fluid collection associated with infection or tumor, either outside the parietal pleura or loculated within the pleural space.,The usual appearance is of homogeneous soft-tissue attenuation capping the extreme lung apex (uni- or bilaterally), with a sharp or irregular lower border (See Figure 6 of PMID:18195376). Thickness is variable, ranging up to about 30 mm. An apical cap occasionally mimics apical consolidation on transverse CT scans.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031983	HP_0032176	Apical pleural thickening,Apical cap
Parenchymal consolidation	Consolidation refers to an exudate or other product of disease that replaces alveolar air, rendering the lung solid (as in infective pneumonia).,In radiographs and CT scans, consolidation appears as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls (See Figure 19 of PMID:18195376). An air bronchogram may be present. The attenuation characteristics of consolidated lung are only rarely helpful in differential diagnosis (eg, decreased attenuation in lipoid pneumonia and increased in amiodarone toxicity).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031983	HP_0032177

Past medical history	In a medical encounter, the physician generally will interview the patient about his or her current problem, and may perform additional testing. The past medical history (PMH) in contrast records information about the patient's medical, personal and family history that might be relevant to the presenting illness or to provide optimal clinical management. The PMH generally includes (if relevant) other major illnesses, hospitalizations, surgeries, injuries, allergies, gynecologic and obstetric history, family history, personal history including occupational history, alcohol and drug use, etc.,This subontology of the HPO is not intended to provide all needed terms to describe the past medical history, but rather to be combined with other ontologies such as MONDO in order to capture information that is often needed to properly assess phenotypic findings related to a presenting medical problem.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000001	HP_0032443

Pulmonary cyst	A round circumscribed space within a lung that is surrounded by an epithelial or fibrous wall of variable thickness. A cyst usually has a thin and regular wall (less than 2 mm) and contains air, although some may contain fluid.,The thin wall of cystic lesions differentiates them from cavitary processes, which have thicker and irregular walls and will not be discussed in this article. On chest radiographs, findings of a cyst are often subtle, consisting of lucencies and sometimes linear opacities. An air-fluid level can improve the visibility of a cyst and may suggest infection. For the investigation of cysts, CT is substantially more sensitive than chest radiography, showing a cyst as a ringlike lucency surrounded by a thin wall.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002088	HP_0032445	Lung cyst

Airborn particle hypersensitivity	An abnormally increased sensitivity to airborn particles. This can be diagnosed on the basis of the medical history, taking into account seasonality or a relationship to the concentration of airborn particles in the environment of the affected individual. Aerosol challenge is a gold standard of establishment of the symptom. There exist particle hypersensitivity (diesel exhaust, metals, inorganic material) vs. allergen (including pollen dander, etc) hypersensitivity. The responses are usually different and testing for allergen hypersensitivity is done in concert with serum IgE and or skin testing to the suspected allergen.,Particles can be defined as any small bits of material or droplets either inorganic or organic, viable or nonviable, that can become airborne. They can range from small molecules less than 0.001 micrometer to pollens and spores ranging between 2 and 50 micrometers and very large visible dust particles in the range of 1000 micrometers. Particles can also assume many shapes including long, fibrous varieties with a length greater than three times diameter, spheres, oddly shaped or irregularly shaped material, oblong, crescent-shaped varieties, or other peculiar shapes, such as certain pollen grains and mold spores.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100326	HP_0032439	
Neonatal omphalitis	An infection of the umbilicus and/or surrounding tissues occurring in the neonatal period.,The umbilical cord stump then gradually dries and typically falls off within 5 to 15 days. Both skin and enteric bacteria may colonize the devitalized tissue of the stump and lead to infection. Omphalitis is, therefore, a polymicrobial infection and the most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010881	HP_0032435	Omphalitis
Abnormal C-reactive protein level	Any deviation from the normal concentration of C-reactive protein in the blood circulation.,C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver, and increases in concentration in response to inflammation.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010876	HP_0032436

Oral melanotic macule	Flat, distinct, discolored area of oral mucosal membrane less than 1 cm wide not associated with a change in the thickness or texture of the affected mucosal membrane. The lesions are small, solitary, well-circumscribed and often uniformly pigmented.,Melanotic macules very rarely, if ever, present larger than one centimeter in diameter. Although these are innocuous lesions, a biopsy is usually warranted for diagnosis since mucosal melanoma can mimic the appearance of a melanotic macule. Melanotic macules are caused by functional hyperactivity of the regional melanocytes ie there is increased melanin production. Histologically, this is evidenced by abundant melanin pigmentation within the basal epithelial cell layer with melanin incontinence in the superficial portions of the submucosa. Importantly, there is no increase in melanocyte number. If there is evidence of melanocytic hyperplasia, it should be diagnosed as such and the lesion would likely warrant complete surgical removal. It is possible that melanocytic hyperplasia may potentially herald the development of malignant melanoma.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100669	HP_0032451	Melanotic macule of oral mucosa
Oral melanoacanthoma	Oral melanoacanthoma usually presents as an asymptomatic, ill-defined, rapidly enlarging, macular pigmentation. Although most lesions are heavily pigmented, the coloration may or may not be uniform. Any mucosal site may be affected, but buccal mucosal involvement is most common. Although typically solitary, rare patients may present with multifocal lesions.,Oral melanoacanthoma is a relatively uncommon melanocytic lesion that may cause rapid, diffuse, and dark pigmentation of a large mucosal area. However, this is an innocuous pathology that is often self-limiting and may spontaneously resolve, with or without surgical intervention.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100669	HP_0032452

Abnormal dermoepidermal hemidesmosome morphology	An abnormal structure or appearance of hemidesmosomes, multiprotein complexes that facilitate the stable adhesion of basal epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane.,Hemidesmosomes (HDs) are highly specialized integrin-mediated epithelial attachment structures that make cells firmly adhere to the extracellular matrix by establishing a link between the underlying basement membrane (BM) and the internal mechanical stress-resilient keratin intermediate filament (IF) network. Although HDs are defined by their ultrastructural appearance, two types of HDs, type I and II, can be distinguished on the basis of their protein components. Classical type I HDs, found in stratified and pseudostratified epithelia, for example in the epidermis, consist in five major components, namely integrin alpha6beta4, plectin isoform 1a (P1a), tetraspanin CD151, bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG)1 isoform e (BPAG1e, also called BP230) and BPAG2 (also called BP180 or type XVII collagen). Type II HDs, found in simple epithelia such as that of the intestine, consist of integrin alpha6beta4 and plectin and lack the two BP antigens.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031538	HP_0032449

Increased circulating palmitate level	An elevation beyond the normal concentration of palmitate (palmitic acid) in the blood circulation.,Palmitic acid (16:0, PA) is the most common saturated fatty acid found in the human body and can be provided in the diet or synthesized endogenously from other fatty acids, carbohydrates and amino acids. PA represents 20-30% of total fatty acids (FA) in membrane phospholipids, and adipose triacylglycerols (TAG).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003455	HP_0032462	
Reduced circulating fibronectin level	A reduction below the normal concentration of fibronectin the the blood circulation.,Fibronectin is a large vertebrate glycoprotein that is found in soluble and insoluble forms and involved in diverse processes. Protomeric fibronectin is a dimer of subunits, each of which comprises 29-31 modules - 12 type I, two type II and 15-17 type III. Plasma fibronectin is secreted by hepatocytes and circulates in a compact conformation before it binds to cell surfaces, converts to an extended conformation and is assembled into fibronectin fibrils.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010876	HP_0032463	Decreased plasma fibronectin

Abnormal phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase activity	Any deviation from the normal activity of the enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphatesynthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of PP-ribose-P from ATP and ribose-5-phosphate.,Intracellular availability of the sugar phosphate, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P), is an important factor in regulation of the rate of purine synthesis de novo. PP-ribose- P synthetase (EC2.7.6.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of PP-ribose-P from ATP and ribose-5-phosphate. An increased activity of PP-ribose- P synthetase can be associated with increased PP-ribose-P concentrations and increased purine biosynthetic rates. Increased purine production in turn can be associated with gout.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0012379	HP_0032459

Elevated cancer Ag 19-9 level	An abnormal increased in the amount of the carbohydrate antigen 19-9, a recognizable sialo-ganglioside in the blood circulation.,CA 19-9 is also referred to as sialyl Lewis-a (sLea). It is expressed on the surface of cancer cells as a glycolipid and as an O-linked glycoprotein. Subsequently, CA 19-9 was also identified in the tissue and sera of patients with other gastrointestinal tumors including esophageal, gastric, biliary and pancreatic cancer. CA 19-9 is derived from an aberrant pathway during production of its normal counterpart disialyl Lewis-a which has one extra sialic acid residue attached through a 2-to-6 linkage. Disialyl Lewis-a is normally expressed on the epithelial surface of digestive organs, serves as a ligand for monocytes and macrophages, and helps in immunosurveillance. Epigenetic silencing of the gene for 2-to-6 sialyl transferase during early stages of carcinogenesis leads to abnormal synthesis and accumulation of sialyl Lewis-a (CA 19-9).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011013	HP_0032345

Decreased head circumference	An abnormally reduced head circumference in a growing child. Head circumference is measured with a nonelastic tape and comprises the distance from above the eyebrows and ears and around the back of the head. The measured HC is then plotted on an appropriate growth chart. Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference (HC) that is great than two standard deviations below the mean of age- and gender-matched population based samples. Severe microcephaly is defined with an HC that is three standard deviations below the mean.,Although HC measures skull size, it typically also reflects overall brain volume and has been described as a widely used proxy of neural growth and brain size. Brain size outside of normal values is an important risk factor for cognitive and motor delay. Microcephaly at birth has been termed primary microcephaly and that acquired after birth is secondary microcephaly.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000240	HP_0040195	Decreased head circumference

Recurrent singultus	A contraction of the diaphragm that repeats several times per minute. In humans, the abrupt rush of air into the lungs causes the epiglottis to close, creating a hic sound. Also known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus, from the Latin singult, the act of catching one's breath while sobbing. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc.,A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups. Persistent or intractable hiccups may be caused by any condition which irritates or damages the relevant nerves.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002795	HP_0100247	Recurrent hiccough,Recurrent synchronous diaphragmatic flutter,Recurrent hiccup,Hiccups,Hiccup

Hemiballismus	Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder that is caused primarily by damage to various areas in the basal ganglia. Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal and/or distal muscles on one side of the body, while some cases even include the facial muscles. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements.,Hemiballismus is a very rare movement disorder. It is five hundred times rarer than Parkinson disease. Its effects can sometimes be severe enough to prevent patients from being able to perform daily functions. It is usually associated with structural brain lesions but can occur with metabolic abnormalities. The symptoms can also decrease while the patient is asleep, unlike some movement disorders. Ballism refers to very large-amplitude choreic movements of the proximal parts of the limbs, causing flinging and flailing limb movements. Ballism is most frequently unilateral, in which case it is referred to as hemiballism	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004305,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002134	HP_0100248	Ballismus

Sarcoma	A connective tissue neoplasm formed by proliferation of mesodermal cells. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main types of sarcoma. Sarcoma is usually highly malignant.,A sarcoma (from the Greek sarx meaning flesh) is a general term describing a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, that arises from transformed connective tissue cells such as bone, cartilage and fat cells, which originate from embryonic mesoderm. This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels).	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011792	HP_0100242	Malignant connective tissue tumor,Cancer of connective tissue

Senile plaques	Senile plaques are extracellular deposits of amyloid in the gray matter of the brain.,Senile plaques can be found in human and animal brains. From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0007367	HP_0100256	Braindruse,Senile druse,Neuritic plaques

Invasive dermatophyte infection	Infection that extends deeply into the dermins by dermatophytes, fungi that typically cause different types of superficial infection (tinea) or skin, hair, or nails.,The most common presentation of dermatophytosis in clinical practice is the appearance of scaly, cutaneous lesions found on the trunk in tinea coporis (ringworm), the feet or toes in tinea pedis (athlete's foot), the crural fold in tinea cruris (jock itch), the scalp in tinea capitis (cradle cap), or a discoloration of the fingernails or toenails in tinea unguium (onychomycosis). Dermatophytosis is a typically noninvasive infection but can evolve into a more aggressive disease in the immunocompromised host.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032162	HP_0032516	
Majocchi's granuloma	Majocchi's granuloma (MG) is an inflammatory and granulomatous, dermatophytic infection characterized by a granulomatous inflammation around the hair follicle. Histopathologically, MG demonstrates a nodular perifollicular granulomatous infiltrate of lymphoid cells, macrophages, epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and neutrophils. Unlike superficial dermatophytoses, fungal hyphae and spores can be detected not only on the surface of the epidermis but also within or around the hair follicles.,Majocchi's granuloma (MG) is classified into two forms, depending on the affected individual's health situation and clinical picture. The first form is mainly observed in healthy individuals and is defined as a perifollicular, papular form induced by penetrating trauma that is mostly observed in the lower extremities. The second form is granulomatous, related to immunosuppression, seen in a nodular form, and usually appears on the upper extremities. The main cause of MG is Trichophyton rubrum, followed by T. mentagrophytes, T. violaceum, and T. tonsurans. However, several fungi, such as T. interdigitale, Microsporum canis, Nannizzia gypsea (former M. gypseum), Epidermophyton floccosum, and Aspergillus species, can also cause MG.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032516	HP_0032517	
Disseminated dermatophytosis	A type of invasive dermatophyte infection characterized by vascular involvement and dissemination to other organs.,Disseminated dermatophytosis tends to occur in patients with both defi cient T cell-mediated immunity and an impaired infl ammatory response. This process occurs either by direct extension, draining lymphatics, or hematogenous spread. It can present with involvement of distant skin areas, lymph nodes, bone, muscle, liver, spleen, testes or the central nervous system. Ultimately, disseminated infection can result in bacterial superinfection, osteomyelitis, organ dysfunction and eventual death.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032516	HP_0032518

Deep dermatophytosis	A type of invasive dermatophyte infection of the deep dermis characterized by extensive dermal infiltration by fungal elements.,Deep dermatophytosis is is found primarily in immunocompromised patients with chronic dermatophytosis. This form of invasive disease may result from follicular rupture with direct cutaneous invasion, sometimes augmented by trauma or topical corticosteroid creams. It is not necessarily associated with hair follicles and tends to be more rapid in onset, larger, and extend deeper than Majocchi's granuloma. These infections can form clusters of granulomas, pseudomycetomas, lymphedema and draining sinuses.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0032516	HP_0032515

Tics	Repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppresable and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement.,Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004305	HP_0100033	Tics,Tic disorder

Gustatory lacrimation	Gustatory lacrimation results from an aberrant innervation of fibres from the seventh cranial nerve to the pterygopalatine ganglion which are destined originally for the submandibular ganglion. This aberrant innervation leads to uncontrollable tearing while eating or in anticipation of a meal.,The aberrant innervation leading to this phenomenon may be seen for example as a hereditary trait in some patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome in which case it may occur unilateral or bilateral, but it may also result from a secondary aberrant reinnervation following a peripheral facial palsy, in which case it is associated with uncontrollable ipsilateral tearing. In the past gustatory lacrimation was considered to be a very rare non-hereditary type of anomalous, cranial nerve-end organ innervation but rare occurences in patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome have shown, that this feature may also appear as a hereditary condition.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031910,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000632	HP_0100274

Abnormality of dorsoventral patterning of the limbs	An abnormality resulting from a defect or disruption of dorsoventral patterning that normally happens during early development of the limbs. A disruption of the normal development of the dorsoventral axis may lead to a variable spectrum of different phenotypic abnormalities that may affect the nails and or palmar and dorsal side of the hands and/or feet, ultimately changing the normal dorsoventral appearance of the affected limbs.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001760,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0001155	HP_0100270

Pretibial dimple	A groove or crease on the shins (pretibial, i.e., over the shin bone). Pretibial creases may be obvious at birth and may range from 3 cm to over 15 cm in length and lenghten as the limb grows. They appear as an elongated dimple because of the attachment of skin to underlying tissue (e.g., to the tibia). The dimple or crease grows in proportion to the growth of the leg.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010781	HP_0032538

Delayed fracture healing	A delay in healing of a fracture past the expected duration.,Initially, after injury a hematoma forms and this is followed by inflammatory cells arriving at the fracture site to debride the wound. During the soft callus phase of healing a collar of bone forms at the periosteum adjacent to the fractured bone, and cells in the periosteum proliferate and differentiate into chondrocytes that form cartilage that bridges the fracture gap. During the hard callus phase, the cartilage is replaced by bone through endochondral ossification, possibly by transformation of some of the chondrocytes into osteoblasts. Finally, through remodeling, newly formed bone is restored to its pre-injured state. Depending on the site of the fracture, healing usually takes from 3 to 12 weeks in healthy adults.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011843	HP_0032537

Positive direct antiglobulin test	A positive result of the direct antiglobulin test (DAT), a method of demonstrating the presence of antibody or complement bound to red blood cell (RBC) membranes by the use of anti-human globulin to form a visible agglutination reaction.,The DAT is a method used to detect immunoglobulin or complement bound in vivo to RBCs, using anti-human reagents. There are 3 different reagents that may be used: monospecific reagents to detect either bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) or bound complement (C3) and polyspecific reagents that can simultaneously detect IgG and/or C3. In screening of RBCs for the presence of bound globulins and/or C3, many laboratories may choose to use the polyspecific reagent initially (ie, as a screen for any bound IgG and/or complement) and, if positive, subsequently use monospecific reagents to specifically distinguish what is bound to the RBC surface.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030057	HP_0032366

Skin only reactions include generalized erythema, urticaria or angioedema without any sentinel features (see below) of other organ involvement.,Hypersensitivity is broadly defined as objectively reproducible symptoms or signs, initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus at a dose tolerated by normal subjects and may be caused by immunologic (allergic) and non-immunologic mechanisms.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100326	HP_0032378	
Polymorphous light eruption	The cardinal symptom is severely pruritic skin lesions. Macular, papular, papulovesicular, urticarial, multiforme- and plaque-like variants are differentiated morphologically, hence the name polymorphous. Usually one morphology dominates in a single individual (monomorphous). The skin lesions develop a few hours to several days after sun exposure. Initially, patchy erythema develops, accompanied by pruritus. Distinct lesions then develop. The upper chest, upper arms, backs of the hands, thighs, and the sides of the face are the primary localizations. The skin lesions resolve spontaneously within several days of ceasing sun exposure and do not leave behind any traces.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000992	HP_0032379	Sun allergy

Cerebral visual impairment	A form of loss of vision caused by damage to the visual cortex rather than a defect in the eye.,The term cortical/cerebral visual impairment (CVI) was coined to describe damage to visual pathways and structures occurring during early perinatal development. The term cortical visual impairment was originally proposed to describe visual dysfunction in pediatric populations of non-ocular cause, and its presumed association with damage to early visual cortical areas. However, as further characterization of this condition progressed, it became evident that CVI was often associated with damage to sites beyond early visual cortex including subcortical structures, white matter pathways, as well as higher-order associative processing areas of the cortex. Thus, the word cortical has been viewed as somewhat of a misnomer, and there has been the suggestion that the term cerebral would be a more encompassing and appropriate term. Although there is still a debate in the community about the most appropriate nomenclature, the HPO will regard these terms as synonymous. It is recommended that more specific terms be used as appropriate for annotation.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000505	HP_0100704	Cortical visual impairment,Cortical/cerebral visual impairment,CVI,Cortical blindness

Schizophrenia	A mental disorder characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0.3-0.7%.,Positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000708	HP_0100753

Cleft maxillary alveolus	Alveolar cleft is a tornado-shaped bone defect in the maxillary arch. Alveolar cleft occurs in response to divergence from normal development during frontonasal prominence growth, contact, and fusion. The most common alveolar portion of the cleft is located between the lateral incisor and the canine.,The palate develops from the frontonasal and maxillary prominences between 4 and 12 weeks of gestation. During gestational weeks 4 to 7, the primary palate originates from the median palatine process, which itself originated from frontonasal prominence. The lip, alveolus, and hard palate anterior to the incisive foramen all share this origin in development. During this period, disruptions of palatal development process can result in primary palate clefting. The secondary palate develops from the lateral palatine processes originating from the maxillary prominences between 7 and 12 weeks, and the hard palate posterior to incisive foramen and the soft palate are developmental products of this process. As such, disruptions during this time will result in secondary palate clefts. The alveolus is a component of the primary palate, and alveolar cleft results from mal-development of the frontonasal prominence. As such, it is most closely related to cleft lip and cleft palate. Generally, alveolar clefts are located between the lateral incisor and canine	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000202	HP_0410003	Cleft primary palate,Cleft anterior maxilla,Alveolar cleft,Cleft alveolar process of maxilla

Chorangioma	Hamartoma-like growth in the placenta consisting of blood vessels.,Chorioangiomas (also known as placental hemangiomas) are benign hamartomatous growth of the placenta comprising vascular tissue. The classification is controversial due to its pathologic features and clinical implications. Some authors call placental hemangiomas as true nontrophoblastic neoplastic tissues. As this abnormal vascular growth seems like the native placental tissue and it does not metastasize, some authors call it just as placental hamartoma. The general incidence is approximately 0.6 percent. Giant chorioangiomas with a diameter over 5 cm are very rare, with an incidence of one in 16-50 thousand pregnancies. Small tumors do not cause any adverse outcomes and they are asymptomatic. In contrast, tumors larger than 5 cm may lead to several complications.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0100767,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0010566	HP_0100883	Placental hamartoma

Angioedema	Rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues of the skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue during a period of minutes to several hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis.,Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0011276,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000969	HP_0100665	Angioneurotic oedema,Quincke edema,Angiooedema

Tibial torsion	Tibial torsion is inward twisting (medial rotation) (PATO:0002155) of the tibia.,Normally, lateral rotation of the tibia increases from approximately 5 degrees at birth to approximately 15 degrees at maturity. Tibial torsion is the most common cause of intoeing. In a study by Mullaji et al to determine tibial torsion norms, individuals in India were found to have less tibial torsion than Caucasians but about the same amount as the Japanese population. The differences in normal tibial torsion values are expected to be caused by the different lifestyles and postures of the different populations, such as cross-legged sitting positions.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002992	HP_0100694

Epidermoid cyst	Nontender, round and firm, but slightly compressible, intradermal or subcutaneous cyst measuring 0.5-5 cm in diameter. Epidermal cysts are intradermal or subcutaneous tumors, grow slowly and occur on the face, neck, back and scrotum. They usually appear at or around puberty, and as a rule an affected individual has one solitary or a few cysts.,A cyst is a cavity containing liquid, semisolid, or solid material. An epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that develops out of ectodermal tissue and consists of a thin layer of squamous epithelium. An epidermal cyst may or may not be painful or release pus, and are usually noticed as a bump on the skin. Epidermal cysts and trichilemmal cysts are clinically indistinguishable. The wall of the epidermal cyst conserves the epidermal layers, but the wall of the trichilemmal cysts, which arise from the external root sheath, shows palisading of unlayered epithelial cells. Homogeneous horny material that is further degraded to fat and cholesterol forms within both types of cysts.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025245	HP_0200040	Skin cyst,Keratin cyst,Infundibular cyst,Epidermal inclusion cyst,Epidermal cyst,Epidermoid cysts,Sebaceous cyst
