# FAIR genomes codebook 

Goal: To create a decor for the FAIRgenomes schema which to could be uploaded in Nictiz.

DECOR (Data Elements, Codes, OIDs and Rules) is a methodology to capture the data needs of caregivers in terms of datasets and scenarios and use it to generate various artefacts: documentation, value sets, XML instance validation, generation and processing support, and test tools etc.

Current version is available at [https://decor.nictiz.nl/art-decor/decor-development--fairgenomes-] (https://decor.nictiz.nl/art-decor/decor-development--fairgenomes-) and is based on this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QCtkNYdDKEaIf_exfFyX7HcJYDV_KkMp_UJQARlKOgk/edit?usp=sharing)
