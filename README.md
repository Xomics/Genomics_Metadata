# Welcome to the repository of the FAIR genomes project. 

FAIR genomes is a project made possible by a [ZonMw subsidy](https://www.zonmw.nl/nl/onderzoek-resultaten/geneesmiddelen/programmas/project-detail/personalised-medicine/fair-genomes-a-national-guideline-to-promote-optimal-reuse-of-ngs-data-in-research-and-healthcare/verslagen/). Within the project we aim to develop a national guideline to promote optimal (re)use of NGS data in research and healthcare.

The project is divided into seven work packages that work together within two streams.

## Most activity is now in work streams
Supporting FAIR data stewardship of genomics data:

[Stream 1 'Requirement analysis' (WP1+4+6+7)](https://github.com/fairgenomes/wiki/wiki/requirements)

[Stream 2 'Inventory of available tools and infrastructure' (WP1+2+3+5)](https://github.com/fairgenomes/wiki/wiki/Stream2): 

## For organisation below also the work-package spaces
